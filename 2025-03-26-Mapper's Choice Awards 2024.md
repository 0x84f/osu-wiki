## Mapper's Choice Awards 2024  

If you ranked any beatmap, guest difficulty, or storyboard in 2024, you’re eligible to help the mapping community pick the most standout creations of the year!  

This year, we’ve made some changes to streamline the event:  
- The number of categories has been reduced.  
- **osu!supporter** will be awarded only for Grand Award categories.  

As with every edition of MCA, the event consists of three stages: **nomination**, **voting**, and **results**. [See below](#schedule) for deadlines and when to expect the final results!  

- **Nomination:** Eligible users can submit beatmaps, storyboards, or users from 2024 that they believe deserve recognition in their respective categories.  
- **Voting:** Eligible users can vote on the pool of submitted nominations.  
- **Results:** Based on voting tallies, the winners will be announced during a livestream, showcasing the podium for each category.  

Visit the [**Mapper's Choice Awards 2024** website](https://mca.corsace.io/2024/) to get started if you’re eligible!
