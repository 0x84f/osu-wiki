As for our August issue, we'll keep you informed about the skinning-related statistics and flamboyant skins to showcase as usual. Unfortunately, we had to omit the News & Tips section of our newspost for this issue due to the lack of noteworthy developments within the community. But no worries! In order to compensate, we're showcasing **4 exquisite skins** published in August, instead of the usual 3!  

That said, this issue of the Skinners' Bulletin will contain the following sections:

- [Monthly Statistics](#monthly-statistics)
- [Skin Showcase](#skin-showcase)

## Monthly Statistics

In August, the skinning forum has seen **39** skins being published, **20** of them consisting of unique components.

## Skin Showcase

As promised, we've loaded up **4** of the coolest skins published within August. We're pretty sure you'll love them as much as we do. Just keep on reading!

### FlatoShabe

Emerging from nowhere, [TKieen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12561202) publishes their minimalistic [FlatoShabe](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1391788) as their second-ever public skin, orienting a straightforward structure. In spite of not differing much from its counterparts, the skin cuts ice thanks to the flavour texts disguised everywhere, equilibrating between a simplistic approach and focusing on details masterfully.

Aside from the detail-oriented style, FlatoShabe is enriched with geometrical shapes covering everywhere with a PlayStation-esque texture from top to bottom. Color choice is instead in favour of the low-contrast colors, yet the palette choice makes the skin easy for the eyes. On the mod selection menu, despite being not-so-preferred for minimalist skins, the mod icons are bloated with details, which seems fitting given the tiny flavour texts visible in many sections. What is more, FlatoShabe provides a `.bat` file that enables you to change the color theme of the entire skin! So cool, isn't it?

Menu interfaces aside, there isn't much to say about the gameplay elements. By keeping things at a minimum, the skin keeps the minimalist structure alive during the playthrough. Regardless, the skip animation and the use of the now-obsolete standard layout in the pause/fail menu add extra beauty to the skin. Overall, FlatoShabe portrays a well-executed minimalist skin with a few nice touches here and there. Hence we would like to keep all the commentary minimal and invite you to watch the showcase video before trying the skin out yourself:

### Ai Hayasaka v3.0

You know what they say: the third time is the charm. [Inflique](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13865585) sets the bar on an astronomical level with his [3rd edition Ai Hayasaka-themed masterpiece](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1394145)! Pursuing a different path contrary to the previous two editions, Inflique has successfully brought together the liveliness of a cartoon and the simplicity of minimalism. These two extremities were merged into one so skillfully that the final product would otherwise look like an abomination. 

The use of arrows and rhomboidal shapes coloured blue and yellow beautifully complement each other and the dotted texture at the background, sending out minimalist yet graffiti-esque vibes. Immediately drawing attention right at the song selection menu, the gfx work covering the osu! cookie parting from the rest of the screen with its unique presentation of the character the skin is revolving around. On the top section of the screen, the use of arrows points out the grouping/sorting menu on the right side very nicely, where the `No Grouping` option stands out with its contrastive red colour without seeming misplaced at all.

The dotted texture of menu sections and buttons covers gameplay elements as well, even hitcircles, which shows us how much delicacy went into details. The arrows and dotted pattern follow us to the pause and fail menus - in other words, *water-break sections* - which are just another example of Inflique's craftsmanship. Ultimately, Ai Hayasaka v3.0 is one-of-a-kind anime-themed skin that manages to shine amongst its counterparts, thanks to the flawless and consistent design carried out by Inflique. No more words to say; just have a look at this showcase video below and give it a try. Oh, and don't forget to stay hydrated!

### Tomioka Giyū

Splashing our bulletin like a tsunami, [Tomioka Giyū](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1405313), by the very hands of [Kim Minnie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3858685), goes further than just being an anime-themed skin by featuring an oil-painting-like look. Brushed into existence with delicacy, Giyū goes down the less-traveled path embracing a flashy and artsy theme, which is quite the opposite of the current minimalism trend.

Before we get into the details on the song selection menu, we highly advise you to use your life vest in case of an emergency, as these deadly waves look like a health hazard! Putting aside the wavy design though, the inkblots appearing in many places, mainly on the buttons and whatnot, reinforce the artsiness to another level. On the background of the game mode selection screen, the fabulous graphic of Tomioka himself greets us with a pose wielding his katana fading into the azureness of the sea. As for the game modifiers, they choose to entertain the portraits of the characters from the anime, where the respective mod is mentioned on the bottom-right corner.

Another distinctive fragment of the skin appears on the gameplay interface, where the top-right of the screen gives out techno vibes, whilst the health bar sustains the artsy-craftsy theme of the main menu, forming a delightful mixture of futuristic nuances and the actual theme of the anime. Speaking of combinations, the fonts also possess such harmony as that, where we notice the handwritten texts assisted with a stretched-out font beneath certain sections. For instance, the pause/fail screens exemplify this attribution very beautifully, in addition to the waves surrounding the menu options as well as the heroic posture of Tomioka Giyū. In any case, grab a surfboard and never hesitate to leave yourself to the tides of Tomioka Giyū, but make sure to watch the showcase video beforehand so as to see what is expecting you out there:

### Kronii no Jikan

Here we are with another detail-oriented [thetasigma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6234482) classic: [Kronii no Jikan](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1406817)! Filled with clockworks from head to toe, the skin revolves around the popular vtuber Ouro Kronii, who is canonically known to be the Warden of Time. As much as thetasigma opted to create an anime-themed skin, there is another version that is entirely Kronii-free you can try. Nevertheless, both versions immediately give out the impression that the skin certainly deserves recognition.

Embracing antiquity very well, Kronii no Jikan is dominated by golden yellow and navy blue, denoting an elegant look on the skin. We encounter a rare layout choice on the menu buttons listed on the bottom-left of the song selection menu, which looks utterly fantastic. The way a game mode is selected denoted by highlighting its respective letter, the way a clockwork is preferred in place of the game modifier menu icon; every detail is noteworthy and shows us thetasigma's mastery once again. Another point reflecting the quality of the skin is, without a doubt, the flavour texts scattered everywhere, especially the one located beneath the `menu-back` button. Cool stuff!

Moving onto the gameplay interface, we see that every aspect of the main menu reflected beautifully here, too. However, this time gear wheels dominate the screen as if we are inside a typical clock. One of the most fabulous parts of the gameplay section is, without a doubt, the pause menu, where menu options surround a clockwork, and the fail menu, which is a cracked copy of the pause menu. Section pass/fail displays are another aspect of the skin dominated by gear wheels and Kronii herself, in addition to the skip button, which is centralized, making it look even more remarkable. In short, we highly recommend you take this lovely creation on a test ride! Thanks to the showcase video below, time constraints are no longer an issue:
