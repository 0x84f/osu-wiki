Spotlights rivals assemble! After a long break, we are finally back, many things changed and so we hope you all are ready for **Winter Season 2022**! <!-- possibly some unorthodox rhythm related thing -->

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/beatmap-spotlights.jpg)

With the new season launch, there will be some major changes regarding gameplay aspects, as well as communication related matters.

If you just can't wait to try out the new maps, **the Beatmap Spotlights lobbies are now open for play on the osu!lazer client**. If you've got no idea how to get started with things, read on below!

## The changes

### New spotlights playlists format

We've heard a lot of voices that the old playlists format might've been a little too boring for more experienced players as one or two extras and/or insanes per list is just simply not enough to be interesting. To increase the competition, and at the same time, to keep it also approachable for newer players, we decided to reshuffle how the playlists system work. **From now on, each playlist will last 2 weeks and will include 2 hard, 3 insane, and 4 extra difficulties.** Each season will consist of 3 playlists, after the first run, the playlists will be re-played for a week.

### Themed playlists

But that's not all regarding the playlists changes. **Starting this season, the first playlist of every season will be themed with some kind of gimmick.** We've came to a conclusion that spotlights playlists might've felt a little disconnected, to make them more interesting, we decided to make the first playlist of every incoming season special. **This time, the theme is unorthodox rhythm of any sorts**.

### More transparency

There's been a lot of voices that nobody really knows who's the member and what's going on in the Spotlighs Team. We'd like to face this issue, and make it so everything is a little bit more clear to the outsiders. Each season announcement will now include *[Inside the spotlights team](inside-the-team)* section, listing the most recent team changes. We will also credit respective curators, resposnible for suggesting the maps, in the [picks lists](playlists). There's more to come in that regard, so stay tuned for the next seasons!

## Medals and beatmap packs

Many people stated that they'd like to enjoy some kind of spotlights experience on stable, like it used to be in the past. To make it somehow possible, we will now release beatmap packs along with medal set for each gamemode once all of the playlists are released (in 4 weeks). We also have plans for releasing medal packs for previous Spotlights seasons. Have fun jumping on grindset to catch them all!

## <a id="inside-the-team"></a> Inside the spotlights team

In this section we will cover member changes and important happenings inside the Spotlights Team.

## The Future

The new Beatmap Spotlights is still a project on its early development stage and depends a lot on community feedback and engagement to improve. Many things can (and will) change for future seasons, and it all depends on *your* feedback!

What do you want for the next season? What needs to be fixed? What are your opinions on the current system? You can voice out all your opinions [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1517423) and we will keep note of every suggestion, so please let us know how you feel about things.

We do hope you have enjoyed the Winter Season 2021 Spotlights, and, of course, we do hope that you enjoy the Spring Season even more.

See you in the upcoming timeshift lobbies!
