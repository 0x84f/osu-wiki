No matter how well the tides of Winter were represented throughout all **17** skins, we required your votes to elect the most wintry ones. It must have been a bitter choice, yet you managed to throw your *snowballots* right back at us. Little did we expect was a total of **17674** frosty votes sent away by **6946** unique users hitting our front yard like an avalanche!

Naturally, it took us a bit of time to count all the votes, make necessary preparations for the announcement and, you know, plough the snow on our yard. At last, we are ready to declare the results!

## 3rd Place - Azure Snowfall

Capturing a total of **1697** hearts with an exquisite yet simplistic piece of art, [Azure Snowfall](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1498492), [thetasigma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6234482) achieves the 3rd place as the contest comes to an end!

Projecting the tides of Winter in a minimalistic approach, Azure Snowfall, as its name suggests, culminates the flakes of snow and the beauty of the sky at night. Opting for shades of dark blue tones almost everywhere, the skin neatly accomodates both the snow and the sky quite artistically. Needless to say, Azure Snowfall provides a delightful stargazing experience from the bluest zeniths of mountains, where the flakes and stars meet.

The song selection menu greets us with a texture filled with mountains everywhere at the bottom section as if we are in the middle of Alps on a sightseeing tour. The remainder holds an elegant yet minimalistic aura, for which creatively built structure of pause and fail menus can be shown as an example. Furthermore, the gameplay section from top to bottom left fairly simple, which goes well with the general theme fascinatingly well! If you don't believe my words, check what sort of a masterpiece Azure Snowfall really is!

Having snowy mountains and shiny stars meet at the horizon, thetasigma gets to achieve the 3rd place profile badge with their Azure Snowfall entry! Much congratz!

## 2nd Place - GanyuTeks:Futur Céleste

**2006** voters chose none other than this tech-style masterpiece delicately crafted by the very hands of [BPChingu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4236855), [GanyuTeks:Futur Céleste](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1489926), reserving them 2nd place on the podium!

As the name might suggest, GanyuTeks:Futur Céleste is heavily inspired by the renowned Genshin Impact character, Ganyu, and locates her into a futuristic theme masterfully. With the snowfall effects alongside Ganyu, who is also known for her associations with the Cryo element in-game, the skin is as much icy as it is minimalistic and futuristic. More importantly, what keeps all that ahold is, without a doubt, the perfect colour palette choice.

Within the details there lies certain textual easter-eggy touches, most of which inform the user about hotkeys and functions, while others carry out background information regarding our fellow Genshin character. From the use of speech bubbles and rectangular layouts to the futuristic lines and notations, the skin gives the impression that as if the player is looking through a visor. In any case, if you are fond of Genshin Impact and you would like to have Ganyu assist you on osu! as well, GanyuTeks:Futur Céleste is the perfect skin for you!

Their beloved masterpiece GanyuTeks:Futur Céleste reserves BPChingu the 2nd place! Of course, what would be a more meaningful award than having Ganyu immortalized as their profile badge for such a delightful entry?

## Winner - - 『Wintherest』 -

Majestically crafted by the hands of a skinner extraordinaire, [Redo\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7122165), [- 『Wintherest』 -](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1498493) takes the lead with **2347** votes, surpassing the 2nd place by a short margin!

Resorting to minimalist and modern styling methods, - 『Wintherest』 - brings the serenity of a wintry day and the vivid display of the aurorae together on your osu! client. The way snow is accumulated near the play button over which the logo of the skin is placed ensures a smooth transition to the anthracite layer that looks like a frosted glass filtering the lights of colour. On top of that, the use of white speech bubbles combined with various minuscule indicators strenghtens the skin's minimalistic ambience even further.

Moreover, - 『Wintherest』 - not only keeps its minimalist and modern look consistent all throughout the skin, but gives the aurora effect further presence, which can be blatantly observed especially on the results screen. The gameplay interface, on the other hand, seems to be unable to keep itself away from this aurora effect, which was placed onto the health, combo and score indicators individually, as well as the usual minimalistic aura. Without a doubt, Redo\_ did it out of the park with this one, and surely the community agrees that their creation is the *Winterest* amongst all!

With their - 『Wintherest』 - entry, Redo\_ gets the reward fit for a champion, a profile badge featuring the very logo of this winning masterpiece! Big congratulations to Redo\_!
