With Project Loved going on for several years now, it's finally time to decide the future of the project.

It's been about [4 years](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/703347) since the last time we've polled the community on the state of Project Loved and the Loved category in general. Recently there's been a lot of heated discussion among the team on where Project Loved should go in its future and we've realised we're lacking one critical component in our decision-making — your input — which is why we've set up a community survey for you to fill out and let us know how we're doing and how we should move forward in the future.

The Project Loved survey is meant to be all-encompasing and it should take no more than 10 minutes to complete, so if you want to weigh in on your thoughts with the category, now is the perfect time for it. Your opinion is very critical to us if we want to take the best steps forward that we possibly can.

If you would also like to contribute more nuanced discussion regarding Project Loved, we have a few different avenues for you to get involved. First and foremost would be the [osu!dev Discord](https://discord.gg/ppy) in the `#osu-loved` channel. We also have a dedicated [forum thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1526909) for discussing things further that wasn't covered in the survey. We will try to keep our ears to the ground with all different kinds of Project Loved feedback, so be sure to get involved!

We'll be making the results of this survey visible sometime before the **April 2022** round of Project Loved. This should be plenty of time for everyone to weigh in on their thoughts so we'll be eagerly waiting for what you have to say!
