In collaboration with [**Monstercat**](LINK), **Stonebank** unveils a new chapter for our Featured Artist library!

![](LINK)

Eardrum-shattering bass has been ringing in the heads of osu! players for years. The culprit, of course, is **Stonebank**.

Amassing millions of plays on iconic beatmaps like [The Pressure](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/325307) and [All Night](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/410998), **Stonebank**'s music is proven to resonate with circle clickers, and is now officially available for use in osu!.

**6** of these unreasonably catchy tunes are now available from [**Stonebank**'s Featured Artist listing](LINK), including the songs above and a solid chunk more!

Check everything out for yourself:

Before we wrap things up here, you deserve a treat: a dive into the *behind-the-scenes* world of osu!'s Featured Artists. 

**Stonebank**'s official involvement in osu! is only possible thanks to help from visionary electronic label **Monstercat**. After months of working with them, we're finally prepared to deliver *more than 100 songs* to the Featured Artist catalogue, and **Stonebank** is only the beginning.

That said, you can explore the above tracks from [**Stonebank**'s Featured Artist listing](LINK), AND from a new [**Monstercat** track listing](LINK). This second listing will be updated with new **Monstercat** songs continually as we announce them through our usual Featured Artist posts!

If you don't want to miss any upcoming **Monstercat** artists (or any other artist announcements), keep watch over the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame). We'll see you on Saturday!
