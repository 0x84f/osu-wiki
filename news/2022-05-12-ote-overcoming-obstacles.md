Do you have a story to share, but no platform to share it on? Join us for the first ever osu! talk event (OTE), hosted by osu! University!

Unlike many events that involve guest speakers, OTE is open for anyone to speak -- all you need is a story to share. Each OTE centers around a certain theme. For this OTE, all talks will center around the theme of **overcoming obstacles**.


If you're not familiar, [osu! University](https://discord.gg/QubdHdnBVg) is an improvement-focused osu! hub that serves to bridge the gap between experienced and new players alike.


Here's a quick rundown of how the event will work:


- **The event will last 3 days total,** from May 20 - 22, 2022.
- **The speaker will use a Discord stage channel** in the [osu! University Discord server](https://discord.gg/QubdHdnBVg) to give their talk.
- **Talks must be less than 18 minutes long**. This is the maximum allowed length, not a goal to aim for — even a 3-minute talk can have massive impact.
- The story you share does not necessarily have to be about osu!, but because it is an osu!-related event, it is recommended to try connecting the story or the lesson behind your story to osu! in some way.
- The event schedule, including the list of all speakers, their scheduled time, and the name of their talk, will be released in the [osu! University Discord server](https://discord.gg/QubdHdnBVg) a few days before the event starts.
- All talks will be streamed live on [osu! University's Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/osuuniversity) and uploaded separately to YouTube after the event on the [osu! University YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/osuuniversity).

If you believe that you or someone you know has a story worth sharing about overcoming obstacles, please fill out this [speaker nomination form](https://forms.gle/HCD6ac8JwURGh8zx8). If you want to nominate someone else, you can still fill out the form on their behalf.


While we would love to accommodate absolutely everyone, due to limited time, we will only be selecting those who we believe are most fit to speak. If you're not selected, don't fret! There will be more events like this one in the future.


We hope you can all join us from May 20 - 22, 2022 for this event! The best way to support us would be to spread the word to anyone you can, especially if you think they would be fit to give a talk.


See you all soon!
