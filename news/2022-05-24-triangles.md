Mappers and storyboarders unite in osu!'s newest contest: **triangles**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/147/header.jpg)

[**lazer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut_SOreClcc) is the next major update to osu!. If you [try it for yourself](https://github.com/ppy/osu#running-osu), you'll notice that osu!'s classic theme song has been replaced by *[cYsmix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/2) - triangles*:

**triangles** is a mapping and storyboarding contest using lazer's theme song, and the winning submission will be **bundled with all new installations of lazer** (along with other cool prizes!).

There's a lot to explain. Let's dive in.

## Teams

To participate in this contest, you need a **team of 2-5 mappers/storyboarders** to create:

- A **triangle-themed** beatmap spread...
  - of the song *[cYsmix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/2) - triangles*
  - following the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) 
  - with **FIVE DIFFICULTIES TOTAL**: Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, and Expert
- A **triangle-themed** storyboard...
  - with a `.osb` file no greater than **1 MB**. This is to ensure the storyboard is well optimised and doesn't take too long to parse and load into the game.

**Submit your team name and member list to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeExd07kLYqp-Mx-lM7Wwxii_qidSUasAlMi3HUHUsdfVSUyg/viewform?usp=sf_link).** Once confirmed, your team will be published on the [*triangles* contest wiki page](/wiki/Contests/triangles_Contest)!

Unlike last year's [A Labour of Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-11-30-a-labour-of-love) contest, entries this time around will remain **anonymous** during the judging phase. This means you should **NOT** upload your submission to BSS or share details about it until *after* judging is completed.

## Schedule

- **May 26 - July 18:** Contest is open for submissions [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/147)!
- **July 19 - July 31:** Submissions are evaluated by a team of judges.
- **August 01 - August 15:** Top beatmaps are published for community vote and lazer playlists.
- **August 20:** Livestream announcement of contest results!

## Prizes

Following the 3-sided theme of **triangles**, we have prizes for 3 types of people on osu!: **mappers**, **storyboarders**, and **competitive players**!

**Mappers** and **storyboarders** are in charge of judging. Each of these groups will evaluate their area of expertise AND the overall beatmap package — all while considering the contest's **triangle** theme.

Prizes will be awarded to all members of the highest scoring team in each category:

### Mapper panel

- **Runner-up:** 3 months of osu!supporter 
- **Winner:**  6 months of osu!supporter + *Mappers' Pick* profile badge

### Community vote

Top beatmaps will be published for a **community vote** and featured in **5 lazer playlists** (one per difficulty level). At this time, teams may reveal their beatmaps to the public.

To participate in the community vote, you will need to play through any of the relevant playlists on lazer. This ensures anyone voting has actually considered all of the options!

- **Community vote runner-up:** 3 months of osu!supporter
- **Community vote winner:** 6 months of osu!supporter + *Community Pick* profile badge

Players have a chance to earn something too! Once the playlists are closed, whoever has the highest score on each leaderboard will receive a minor prize too:

- **Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane playlist leaders:** 1 month of osu!supporter each
- **Expert playlist leader:** 1 month of osu!supporter + *triangle aficionado* profile badge

Once *everything above* is finalized, we'll announce the results in a **livestream showcase of the finalists** with commentary from some of the judges!

In case one team wins multiple categories, we'll combine their profile badges accordingly. Sorry profile badge collectors, you only receive one.

## Rules

Surprising absolutely nobody, this contest has RULES:

- **Submission must include the following:**
  - A beatmap spread of *cYsmix - triangles* with **FIVE DIFFICULTIES TOTAL**: Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, and Expert. [Download the beatmap template here!](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/2/Songs/cYsmix%20-%20triangles.osz)
  - A storyboard with a `.osb` file no greater than **1 MB**. This is to ensure the storyboard is well optimised and doesn't take too long to parse and load into the game.
- **Submission must be no greater than 10 MB.** While not required, we recommend designs that use simple shapes, keep resources to a minimum, and align with lazer's approach to UI design.
- **Submission must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Beatmaps must be in *osu!* game mode only.** Comparing beatmaps of different modes in a judging scenario is unfortunately not realistic.
- **Beatmaps should abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be disqualified.
- **Team name and members must be confirmed through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeExd07kLYqp-Mx-lM7Wwxii_qidSUasAlMi3HUHUsdfVSUyg/viewform?usp=sf_link).**
  - If your country does not support Google Forms, [send pishifat a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418).
  - Teams must have 2-5 members.
- **Submissions must not be publicly revealed until after the judging phase ends.**
- **Submissions must not be Qualified until after the community vote ends.**
