That's a lot of songs, we know. And there's even more on [**Rameses B**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/270) waiting for you to begin your mapping journey. Don't keep them waiting.

## Featured Artists in lazer

Speaking of awesome new things, we're also experimenting with **Featured Artists in lazer playlists** starting TODAY.

For **1 month**, playlists of recent Featured Artist beatmaps will be open for *all modes*, and the **highest 3 ranking players** in each playlist will receive a Featured Artist themed profile badge!

![Featured Artist profile badge](LINK)

We're keeping things simple with a playlist that doesn't allow any mods, but we'll dive into more complicated playlist requirements going forward!

### How to participate

Not sure what *lazer* or *playlists* are? [Catch up here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut_SOreClcc)

If you want to participate in new Featured Artist playlists, download lazer from its [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/latest). From lazer's main menu, enter the **playlists** section and filter the lobbies to **Featured Artists** in the top right corner. Enter a lobby, play each map, then you'll see your name on the leaderboards!

And... that's all for now! Go play some **Rameses B** maps and stay tuned for more Featured Artists next month!
