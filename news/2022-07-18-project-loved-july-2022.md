[Eve - Gekka\*Midare Botan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/957390#osu) by [Nameless Player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4133758)\
200 BPM, 4:54 | 7.71★\
*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

From a new name to the Loved Category, but quite well known as a player, Nameless Player's *Gekka\*Midare Botan* hits the sweet spot of a classic aim map.

At 7.71\*, 200 BPM and with a 5 minute runtime, the map doesn't take punches, yet gives a consistent challenge of cross screen aim and spaced streams. The map hits all of the basics, and does it quite flawlessly; despite the high difficulty, it remains comfortable to play and visually clean throughout.

I hope you enjoy, and make sure to vote on the link above if you wish to see this map enter Loved!

*description written by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983)*

If you're looking for streams, you're going to be well stocked with this one. *Stop Saying We Sound Like Dragonforce* sure sounds like that famous Power Metal band to me, and the map is exactly what you would expect!

You want 200 BPM streams? You got it. This is a polished mapset that is almost nothing but streams — very spaced, winding, curvy worms for you to mash away at. There are four difficulties, ranging from 5 stars to almost 7.8 stars, so stream aficionados are well catered for here!

This is the sort of set where you don't have to worry about many big jumps or weird patterns, so you can just focus on those streams. It's easy to see why this has become so popular among players of many skill ranges. Why not have a crack at this intense map yourself? Then, once you've given your hands a good break, give us your vote by clicking the link above!

*description written by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983)*

For any player who plays a lot of maps from the early osu! days, Susumu Hirasawa is one of the artists that stand out the most, often accompanied by a crazy map by [Starrodkirby86](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/410). In 2015, the popular top player MouseEasy created this jumpy challenge map for one of the most iconic Susumu songs in osu!, *SWITCHED-ON LOTUS*, and the inspiration from the classic KIRBY Mixes is clear to see.

With lots of symmetrical jumps placed in varied and tricky patterns, all set at 230 BPM, this isn't just a test of your aim abilities, but your control abilities too. From acute angle aim, to wide linear lines, this map has it all. The rhythm is very freeform, much like the rhythms you would find in the original Kirby map, except you'll have to manage 6.7 stars of spacing on top of that!

A classic jump map in every sense of the term. Does this tribute deserve a spot in Project Loved?

*description written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

One of the OG "flow aim tech" maps, this map has stood the test of time like no other. At 165 BPM, this map will have you flying through cut streams, slider streams, triangle streams, square streams- wait, what?

Trust me, it's even better than it sounds. You've never seen a 7-star tech map quite like this one.

*Ciyus Miapah* is back again with a final boss map that will push all of your skills to their absolute limit. The objects in this map represent the obstacles that you must destroy as you travel through time to stop the king from [Euphoria](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/890438) from being captured. With 210 BPM deathstreams and tech patterns in your way, can you save the world from chaos?

Well, don't judge a book by its cover. This map is actually pretty cool. It also has a bunch of diffs—9 to be exact.

One of the most exciting TV size maps you'll ever play.

While there are many maps of the song Teo out there, this full-spread mapset hits the spot for over 680 players. Featuring six difficulties between 2 and 6.7 stars, each difficulty is filled with comfortable yet satisfying 185 BPM jumps. While that might sound like any other map out there, I recommend giving this map a go to see what the hype is all about.

Fast aim nomod players rejoice!! This map contains non-stop 270 BPM jumps with some of the most satisfying angles and hitsounds you'll see. Mind the star rating, though—7.5 stars is nothing to scoff at.

You got this, though.

If you can make it to the end, there's a special treat waiting for you in the form of sliders that are so much fun they'll have you wondering, "why didn't I find this map sooner!?"

*description written by [Boaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13302996)*

I hope you're all ready for this month's gimmick map, because this is one hell of a ride. Don't let the calm melody and aesthetically pleasing barlines fool you, this map is extremely challenging if you're not a barline expert.

*Asian dancer* starts off by introducing the gimmick with some easy and visually stunning barlines in the background while you're playing the longer patterns, but it won't take long until the notes start to get mixed in with them! Later on, this map features lots of longer patterns with only barlines, an amazing 0 BPM section, and overall great artwork which you should really check out yourself.

Now let's dance our way into the next pick, shall we? :)

*Waga Na ha Gorori* is a product of many famous mappers, and it's popular with a wide range of players. Thanks to its span of difficulties, this makes for good high BPM practice. I'm sure you have all played this map at one point or another, so we hope you're happy to see this in Loved voting!

174.6 BPM, 2:36 | 6.89★\
*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

As one of Silentroom's most popular songs, we decided to feature Nhelv by 1RoHa_, a unique take on the song with a very fun to play, entry level tech map that perfectly captures the vibe of the neurofunk sections.

With patterns that vary wildly from snap to snap, this might be one of the trickiest maps to full combo for people trying to get into tech maps. Not only are the patterns very difficult to hit, they also go quite high on SV, contrary to a lot of other tech maps which often are on the lower end of scrolling, making this very refreshing to play.

Hope you enjoy this one!

240 BPM, 2:10 | 8.64★, 9.21★\
*description written by [Boaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13302996)*

\_yu68 returns to the Loved battlefield with yet another map for the real speed demons to enjoy. For those who don't know, "splittercore" is subgenre of speedcore that makes use of extremely high tempos, and this song is not any different. The Challenger difficulty features lots of 360 and 480 BPM bursts within 240 BPM streams, so the name isn't joking about this being a real challenge, even for the speediest among us.

To the people who still wanted to play this without HT, it's your lucky day, since this mapset features a nerfed difficulty as well! Don't let it fool you though, it still includes the long 240 BPM streams with some 360 BPM bursts now and then.

This concludes this month's osu!taiko Loved picks, we hope you all enjoyed them and make sure you don't get any injuries playing this map in particular!

Overall it is clean and plays nice, with a few unrankable patterns here and there which do not greatly impact the way it plays. It is probably not very difficult for experienced players, so trying it with mods may be encouraged. Have fun!

So.

This is the official way we've found to put *Galaxy Collapse* in the Loved section somehow. Please bear with us.

Jokes aside, *osu!mania memories* is an absolute nostalgia trip, and nostalgia trips are something that the Loved team is particularly fond of. This is a direct follow-up to the general concept of "osu!memories": see osu!standard's [ranked](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/532522#mania/1128411) and [Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/530986#mania/1125406) interpretations, as well as the previously [Loved osu!mania collaboration](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/535878#mania/1203547) on it.

Featuring iconic songs from sets from [2012](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/63089#mania/193131) right up to, of course, [the infamous aforementioned boss song](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/400078#mania/992512), the map was built by an array of equally iconic contributors to the ranked section. However, it does seem like a long compilation of songs and maps that culminate to over 6 stars in difficulty is especially difficult to rank, especially when the collaboration aspect comes into play. With collaboration between the osu!mania Beatmap Nomination team and the Project Loved team, we have determined that *osu!mania memories* was best suited for the Loved section rather than the ranked section.

Feel free to discuss the development of this mapset in the voting thread with your own reasoning, and also contribute to the votes; we feel it would be particularly fruitful for not only the development of the Loved section itself, but also the ranked section, that the community utilizes its voice and tells us what they want.

Player0 has been a recurring name in the mania storyboarding scene, with other quite intriguing Loved entries [*Lagtrain*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1405100#mania/2897720) and [*polygon*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1066137#mania/2232416). They make a banger of a return this month with lapix's *Nothing but Theory*!

For "conventional" SV players, this is going to be a little bit of a departure from the usual monthly treat, but *Nothing but Theory* lends itself to be fairly playable and actually fun to learn for a storyboarded map. Plus, you might already know the song from [H1Pur's interpretation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1422643) for SVSE qualifiers.

For us Loved captains, it is only from theory that we submit this set for voting: it is up to you all to make it a reality in practice by casting your vote!

*Tiny Litte Adiantum*, better known as the "Already Dead" instrumental, is a straightforward jack chart. The high density but low BPM combine to give an approachable experience that has contributed to its massive popularity, as clearly seen by the many thousands of plays it has accumulated.

This one goes out to all those Greek alphabet fans out there. On a more serious note, many people \[i\](including us)\[/i\] would say that this chart was long overdue. Let us give yet another welcome to Shoegazer in the Loved polls with another staple chart of theirs: *Odoru Mizushubuki*!

For those unaware of the map, you should expect a fun and challenging technical chart focused on periodic bursts and an emphasis on small anchors here and there. While it might seem deceptively easy on the lower rates, those seeking something more difficult are assured to find it by just trying something slightly faster. Difficulty won't scale linearly, but the fun is sure to do!

In any case, we really hope everyone gives it a try. I'd also encourage those who have only played on the uprated version to give a try on its original speed. *Might help you mald a little less just because you couldn't get an arbitrary 96%\~.*

Hot take, but Ratatouille is the main reason why Gen Z people suffer from Paris syndrome. Despite those concerns though, such a film has inspired notBrandon to chart *Camille's Le Festin* in quite an interesting and engaging way!

When getting into this map, do expect having to deal with a long note release fiesta. It's really fun if you can nail it, but if you lack the coordination, you're going to be in for a bad time. Maybe it's the faster bursts that might throw you off. Maybe it's the walls you'll have to face. In any case, the song and chart slaps, and just for once I'm thankful to the French for that reason.

After over a year (or almost three if you do not count guest difficulties), Wilben_Chan returns to the Loved category with his chart of M2U's *Loadstar*!

This is a good practice chart for LN players of lower levels. There's a simple charm in playing it, at just 90 BPM, but it's surprisingly easy to get tripped up by the coordination required for a chart like this. Even still, it is still a much more relaxed LN chart than most others currently in osu!mania's Loved category.

Vote today if you want to see *Loadstar* in the Loved section!
