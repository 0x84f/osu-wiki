You know what they say: third time is the charm! For the third edition of Skinning Contest, hosted by one of the largest skinning communities, [skinship](https://skinship.xyz/), we are here to invite all skinning enthusiasts to compete against one another and show off their talents. For those unfamiliar with what this is all about, check out the [wiki index page](/wiki/Contests/Skinning_Contest) for previous iterations.

Sliding out of last edition's Tides of Winter and its breezing nature, we have decided to table themes for another time and give our contestants a more spacious design environment. However, in an effort to keep the competition up and running, we will be introducing a challenge for you: **Chromatic Alteration**! You may find the details down below.

## Challenge: Chromatic Alteration

In place of a particular theme, this edition of Skinning Contest features a limitation:

**The colour palettes of all skin submissions must be limited to the visible spectrum of the following colour vision deficiency types**:

- **Protanopia**
- **Deuteranopia**
- **Tritanopia**

Bear in mind that your skin must feature **only one** of these colour spectra. Additionally, major portion of your skin must consist of colours other than black and white, even though all three palettes contain them.

## Changes

As per the feedback we've received from you, we've decided to make a couple of adjustments and improvements to this edition of the contest:

- **Submissions must not be created as a part of, or involved in a paid commission of any sort**. We encourage contestants to keep their monetary transactions out of the boundaries of the contest in order to ensure a fair and square competitive environment. 
- The cover image appended to your submission must be at least **1280x720 (16:9)**. These will be used on the contest page representing your submission.

All of the changes above can be viewed in detail in the [Rules](#rules) section below. Make sure to have a read!

## Participation

As always, you are required to create a new skin from scratch in order to participate. There's no point in hosting a competition amongst aged skins after all! 

You must create a forum thread to accompany the skin for it to be a valid submission. Advertising your skin, though, is completely up to you! Said forum thread must be located under the [Skinning WIP subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/119).

Lastly, don't forget to leave a post under the [submission thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1612259), otherwise you won't make it to the contest!

Since all entries will have their respective forum threads publicly available, contestants and their submissions will not be anonymized. In fact, we encourage you to show off your work as much as you want!

## Voting

After the submission phase is over, the entries will be made available for community voting.

The results of the community voting will determine the winner of the contest. The entry with the most votes wins!

## Schedule

- Submission phase: **5** weeks starting from the release of this newspost
- Voting phase: **2** weeks starting from a separate newspost

## Rules

- Submissions must not contain inappropriate, malicious, or epileptic content, and should adhere to the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules).
