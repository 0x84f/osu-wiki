# Introducing osu!monthly

It has been a long time since the last osu!weekly was released and luckily, we have something exciting to show you: osu!monthly! The new community news post format.

6 years have passed since the last community post of this type. Today, this changes with an all-to-familiar, but larger-in-scope version, dubbed: ***osu!monthly***.


## Word of the editors :

Keeping the news post somewhat simple until the team can establish a foundation that is worked on through community feedback, suggestions, and what you, the readers, would like to see more of. The team decided to keep July's edition on the lighter end of the content to make sure the news post has a solid foundation to what *we* hope will gather interest and pose more involvement for the news post and the community.


It'll never be the same as osu!weekly, but we're working hard to propose a frequent format, please be kind to us, new writers! We're highly receptive to it, so feedback is highly appreciated!

## What's up in osu!? 

Here are the latest updates, events, and more!

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/osu.png) osu! 

#### If you ask us what is the big event of July, it'd be the [Roundtable](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-08-the-roundtable)!

<br>

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-08-01-osumonthly-1/roundtable/RTable_title.png)

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-08-01-osumonthly-1/roundtable/RTable_players.jpg)

With the players showcased above, we have [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691) and [Happystick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/256802) commentating, a genius roster that makes sense for this first **IRL osu! invitational**!

As if it wasn't enough, [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) was there too! If you weren't able to follow the event, no worries! The official Roundtable's YouTube channel has the full VODs [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fSQd4oKBPxkBR93GucCUg/featured)!

With that many great players, such as [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902), [Utami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7512553), [RyuK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6304246), and many others, this tournament was incredible! The competition's spirit was mixed with the entertaining cast and gimmicks of [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691) and the result was nothing but epic!

In terms of epic, we were served with the finals: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) vs [Utami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7512553)! Despite mrekk's defeat against [Utami]([Utami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7512553)), his performances were impressive, along with [Utami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7512553)'s. His first rank on the leaderboard is indeed his throne.

A best-of from this match was made on the [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691) [channel](https://twitch.tv/btmc), with exclusive interviews of the players, by [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691) (what a surprise, ahah) and Happystick, the casters of this amazing show! You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7LqBZL)!

Anyway, The Roundtable has now ended, we can't wait until the next edition!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Roundtable will return.<br>Thank you, everyone ❤️</p>&mdash; BTMC (@btmclive) <a href="https://twitter.com/btmclive/status/1546335465518682112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2022</a></blockquote>

[*Find the forum article here!*](/news/2022-07-08-the-roundtable)

Thanks again to [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691) and his staff for this insane event! 

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/taiko.png) osu!taiko

As if we could allow for osu! to take all the glory in its showcasing of top players and their performances, osu!taiko takes it upon itself to rival even that of [*The Roundtable*](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-08-the-roundtable) with their very own annual entry of **[Expert Global Taiko Showdown 2022](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022)**!

As the name implies, the showdown is to take place between those whose dreams consist of taiko drumming, kiai slider velocity shenanigans, dons, katsu, and quite possibly, even, Taikonator 3000! This is a tournament that showcases those whose passion for Taiko is not just exemplary in their gameplay but in every other way. 

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/catch.png) osu!catch

*At the beginning of July, the recent eleventh iteration of the [osu!catch World Cup 2022](/wiki/en/Tournaments/CWC/2022) has been concluded.*

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-08-01-osumonthly-1/podium.png)

For the fourth time in a row and a total of eight wins, South Korea are the osu!catch champions. The roster consisted of [JISAN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3657951), [Rells](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7937519), [YesMyDarknesss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549), [x_angelkawaii_x](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276), [DreStar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1808057), and [Byeol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2754651). With second and third places won by the United States ([Secre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637), [Lexii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7226149), [Dahcreeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006), [Zak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375955), [Colin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5502521), [Elux](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12004983)) and China ([Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210), [Callionet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3072921), [Coevir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171965), [Crystal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1646397), [KagamineRin02](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/518503), [Kitakami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6347308)), respectively.

It is no secret that players from South Korea are so good that they could swap with each other and win the entire tournament no matter what they were faced up against. With [qwhj1027](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7547506) and [Abstract-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3097304) not being in the South Korean team like the previous year, some analysts had doubts that they could claim the winning title this year. Thankfully or not, that wasn't the case here at all. With 11 maps lost in this entire tournament, South Korea showed that even without the strongest players this game could produce, there are plenty of players ready to take their shot at impressing the community and the crowd.

The United States entered this tournament with almost the same roster with swapping [Kisetsunotori](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3692648) to [Elux](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12004983) being the only roster change. Although they've fallen to the losers bracket after playing a match against South Korea, the United States showed their determination to achieve something worthy. In the end, they've claimed themselves as grand finalists for the second time in this world cup.

With the recent change of swapping from Group Stages to Qualifiers format, most of the players and viewers didn't expect to see China on the top despite failing their previous run placing 7th—8th place. Their expectations were worth it in the end as they instantly gained their glory reaching the winner's finals bracket without losing a single match until clashing with South Korea and, ultimately, the United States. Even with a long year of absence, China showed that even being absent for an entire year they can still make a good fight with top teams.

There are still plenty of tournaments running, even after the conclusion of CWC! The digit tournaments, [4 Digit Catch World Cup 2022](/wiki/en/Tournaments/4CWC/2022) and [3 Digit Catch World Cup 2022](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1580097 ), are up and running and the second iteration of [Catch French Dual Cup 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1605746) is currently in the registering phase. There's nothing to talk about these tournaments just quite yet, but maybe with the new osu!monthly release we can fully recap what infamous rivalries transpire along with the conclusions, and maybe something new!

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/mania.png) osu!mania

#### In August, the osu!mania top players will brawl in the osu!mania World Cup 2022!

As it is starting the on **6th of August**, we can't actually talk about it more, but we are excited to say that the next osu!monthly is going to have a **big article** about it, and maybe an **interview of the winner**!

## Top scores of the Month!

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/osu.png) osu!

#### As if the impossible could not be done only once, but twice!?

[\[Karcher\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11443437) is an absolute madman! Achieving an insane Full Combo on [*Yomi yori Kikoyu, Koukoku no Tou to Honoo no Shoujo*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461744#fruits/1031991) to ever hit the ranked section. For just over 8 minutes of gameplay at a staggering 220 BPM it is no small feat, and thus, should be showed off for osu!’s monthly pick!

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://youtube.com/embed/HMQKYkffUjk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/taiko.png) osu!taiko

#### Whew! If you thought the pick for osu! was crazy, wait 'till you watch [shinchikuhome’s](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3174184) DT play on [Apollo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1739877#taiko/3558252)! 

This taiko play is set at  an average of 411 BPM, yes, you read that right! **411 BPM!**. This is truly an insane play for any speed enthusiasts and absolute taiko enjoyers. Make sure to show some love and enjoy the absolute speed demon plays shinichikuhome is known for!

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="<link>https://youtu.be/embed/hKwIKC-DvcU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/mania.png) osu!mania

#### The mania k-pop community is going to be absolutely ecstatic at this next showcase. 

With [Onta_Bekasi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8677684) not just clearing, but FCing the deceptively difficult yet soothing myriad of LNs and intricate patterns that [My Man](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/514681#mania/1093212) so elegantly puts on display, it is of incredible skill, and no small effort, that [Onta_Bekasi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8677684) only suffers a 00.02 accuracy drop across a 3-minute map and over 5000 notes. Truly a wonderful display of what osu!mania can offer, enjoyment of the game, and is a play that is more than deserving of being showcased.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="<mania 7k>https://youtu.be/embed/1RuyJ3y_ot4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Wow. Just completely shocked at this performance by [[GS]Myuka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733) on [Camellia’s - MI11I0N PP](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1388481#mania/2867552). 

If you thought *My Man* had LNs, wait until you see a map of over 7 minutes of non-stop LN gameplay, and with not just single-note rainbows and glissandos, but an interconnected web of the two. It is an impeccable display of skill, accuracy, speed, and just what osu!monthly is looking for in a showcase!

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="<mania 4k>https://youtu.be/embed/nc_ejGtZKUM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/catch.png) osu!catch

#### Somebody scream! Even with being the number one osu!catch player in the world, a play such as [YesMyDarkness’](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549/fruits) is no small feat. 

Coming in with a HD HR 4xmiss on [Kurokotei’s Galaxy Collapse](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/521900#fruits/1108507) one of the most well known artists and songs in osu! surely does do them some justice. Riddled with intense and **dash**ingly hard jumps it is a play to contend with even the hardest of maps, let alone with hidden and hardrock!

## New Features on osu!lazer!

The new client has never been that **close** from releasing (there's still a lot of work on it!), and has **new mods**, more original than never! 
For the first time ever, lazer patch notes have been posted on the official osu! [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/osugame), compiled by [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) with further insight provided by the man himself, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2)!
Check the video out:

If you are interested in all previous and future patch notes, you can find them [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog).

One thing you might've missed is the new fancy Repel mod added to lazer, which is pretty chaotic but fun (finally a worthy opponent for [badeu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1473890)?)

Another feature that's maybe not the newest, but some of you might have missed, or just haven't gotten around to trying yet is the **skin layout editor**! First implemented in May of 2021, this is still very much a work-in-progress feature, however currently you are able to edit the placement of all skin elements that appear during gameplay! Check out the showcase video from the original patch notes below:

## Month's Community Quiz

A monthly question or puzzle for you!

---

>Once upon a time, in the ye' old osu!, someone asked for advice from the ancestors among osu!, the post reads as follows: 

>"Is it possible to repeat songs in osu!? I have an in-game video of KH2 with Roxas battling the Twilight Thorn (people who have played Kingdom Hearts 2 will be drooling) and the video is still halfway when the song ends! Or can someone at least tell me about a free, easy to use software which can solve my problem by repeating the song?"

>This ancient tome is hidden behind a code, the code you seek is everywhere but no where at the same time, always in the back of your mind but only breaching the surface at the moment you see it, now… go forth, unveil the secret code, and paste the number in the link, and gain access to this ancient tome!

>The first person to answer it correctly will receive a month of osu!supporter, leave your answer in the comment!
