The weekly newsletter returns in a monthly format — find out about happenings around the community!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/osu-monthly-1.jpg)

5 years have passed since the last [the last community post of this type](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-06-07-osu-weekly-106). Today, this changes with an all-too-familiar but larger-in-scope version, dubbed **osu!monthly**, the new community newsletter.

This news post will be kept somewhat simple until the team can establish a foundation through community feedback, suggestions, and what you, the readers, would like to see more of. This July edition is therefore on the lighter side content-wise in order to be able to focus on what we hope will gather interest and more involvement for the news post and the community.

It'll never be the same as osu!weekly, but we're working hard to propose a frequent format, please be kind to us new writers! We're highly receptive to it, so feedback is highly appreciated!

## Table of contents

## What's new in osu!?

Here are the latest updates, events, and more!

#### The Roundtable

If you ask us what is the big event of July, it'd be the [Roundtable](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-08-the-roundtable)!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-08-01-osumonthly-1/roundtable/RTable_title.png)

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-08-01-osumonthly-1/roundtable/RTable_players.jpg)

With global rank #1 player [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902), among other great players such as [Utami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7512553), [RyuK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6304246) and many others, this tournament was truly a congregation of titans, a genius roster that makes sense for this first **IRL osu! invitational**!

Commentary for the entire event, along with gimmicks and constant focus on competitive spirit, was provided by [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691) and [Happystick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/256802), and the result was nothing but epic!

In terms of epic, we were served with the finals of **mrekk vs. Utami**. Despite mrekk's defeat against Utami, his performance was nothing short of impressive, demonstrating that his first rank on the leaderboard sits unwavered.

[Highlights for this match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7LqBZL) were made on BTMC's [YouTube channel](https://twitch.tv/btmc), with exclusive interviews of the players, by BTMC (what a surprise), [Kroytz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2339768) and Happystick, the casters of this amazing show!

If you weren't able to follow the event, no worries! The official [Roundtable YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fSQd4oKBPxkBR93GucCUg/featured) has the full VODs.

Anyway, The Roundtable has now ended, we can't wait until the next edition!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Roundtable will return.<br>Thank you, everyone ❤️</p>&mdash; BTMC (@btmclive) <a href="https://twitter.com/btmclive/status/1546335465518682112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2022</a></blockquote>

[**See the event announcement post here!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-08-the-roundtable)

Thanks again to BTMC and his staff for this insane event!

#### EGTS 2022

As if we could allow osu! to take all the glory in showcasing top players and their performances. Members of the osu!taiko community take it upon themselves to rival even that of [The Roundtable](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-08-the-roundtable) with their very own annual entry of **[Expert Global Taiko Showdown 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022)**!

As the name implies, the showdown is to take place between those whose dreams consist of taiko drumming, kiai slider velocity shenanigans, dons, katsu, and quite possibly, even, Taikonator 3000! This is a tournament that showcases those whose passion for Taiko is not just exemplary in their gameplay but in every other way. 

The GTS team's insanely talented designer ::{{ flag=PH }}:: [OsuMe65](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/852867), has also made a trailer for the tournament. Check it out and leave your thoughts down below!

#### osu!catch World Cup 2022 concludes

At the beginning of July, [osu!catch World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2022), the eleventh iteration of the series, was concluded.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-08-01-osumonthly-1/podium.png)

For the fourth time in a row and a total of eight wins, South Korea is the osu!catch champion. The roster consisted of [JISAN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3657951), [Rells](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7937519), [YesMyDarknesss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549), [x_angelkawaii_x](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276), [DreStar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1808057), and [Byeol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2754651). United States ([Secre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637), [Lexii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7226149), [Dahcreeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006), [Zak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375955), [Colin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5502521), [Elux](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12004983)) and China ([Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210), [Callionet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3072921), [Coevir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171965), [Crystal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1646397), [KagamineRin02](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/518503), [Kitakami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6347308)) took second and third place respectively.

It is no secret that players from South Korea are so good that they could swap with each other and win the entire tournament no matter what they were faced up against. With [qwhj1027](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7547506) and [Abstract-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3097304) not being in the South Korean team like the previous year, some analysts had doubts on whether they could claim victory this year again. Thankfully or not, that wasn't the case here at all. With 11 maps lost in this entire tournament, South Korea showed that even without the strongest players this game could produce, there are plenty of players ready to take their shot at impressing the community and the crowd.

The United States entered this tournament with almost the same roster with swapping [Kisetsunotori](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3692648) to [Elux](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12004983) since last time. Although they've fallen to the losers' bracket after playing a match against South Korea, the United States showed their determination to prove their worth. In the end, they've claimed themselves as grand finalists for the second time in this World Cup.

With the recent change of swapping from a Group Stage to a Qualifier format, most players and viewers didn't expect to see China on the top despite failing their previous run placing 7–8th. Their expectations were worth it in the end as they instantly gained their glory reaching the Winners' Finals bracket without losing a single match until clashing with South Korea and, ultimately, the United States. Even with a long year of absence, China showed that even after being absent for an entire year they can still put up a good fight against top teams.

There are still plenty of tournaments running, even after the conclusion of CWC!, the digit tournaments, [4 Digit Catch World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/4CWC/2022) and [3 Digit Catch World Cup 2022](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1580097 ), are up and running, and [Catch French Dual Cup 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1605746) is currently in the registration phase. There's nothing to talk about these tournaments just quite yet, but maybe in the next osu!monthly releases we can fully recap what infamous rivalries transpired along with the conclusions!

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/mania.png) osu!mania

#### osu!mania 4K World Cup begins

In August, the osu!mania top players will brawl in the osu!mania 4K World Cup 2022!

As it is starting the on **6th of August**, we can't actually talk about it more, but we are excited to say that the next osu!monthly is going to have a **big article** about it, and maybe an **interview of the winner**!

[**Read more about it here!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-07-osu-mania-4k-world-cup-2022-registrations-now-open)

## Top scores of the month

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/osu.png) osu!

#### Yomi Yori Madness

As if the impossible could not be done only once, but twice!?

[\[Karcher\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11443437) is an absolute madman, achieving an insane full combo on [Yomi yori Kikoyu, Koukoku no Tou to Honoo no Shoujo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461744#fruits/1031991) to ever hit the Ranked section. For just over 8 minutes of gameplay at a staggering 220 BPM it is no small feat, and thus, should be showed off for osu!'s monthly pick!

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://youtube.com/embed/HMQKYkffUjk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/taiko.png) osu!taiko

#### Speed of the gods

Whew! If you thought the pick for osu! was crazy, wait 'till you watch [shinchikuhome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3174184)'s DT play on [Apollo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1739877#taiko/3558252)!

This taiko play is set at an average of 411 BPM. Yes, you read that right, **411 BPM**! This is truly an insane play for any speed enthusiast and absolute taiko enjoyer. Make sure to show some love and enjoy the absolute speed demon plays shinichikuhome is known for!

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/mania.png) osu!mania

#### Superstars strike

The mania k-pop community is going to be absolutely ecstatic at this next showcase. 

With [Onta_Bekasi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8677684) not just clearing, but FCing the deceptively difficult yet soothing myriad of LNs and intricate patterns that [My Man](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/514681#mania/1093212) so elegantly puts on display, it is of incredible skill, and no small effort, that [Onta_Bekasi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8677684) only suffers a 00.02 accuracy drop across a 3-minute map and over 5000 notes. Truly a wonderful display of what osu!mania can offer, enjoyment of the game, and is a play that is more than deserving of being showcased.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://youtu.be/embed/1RuyJ3y_ot4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Millions of long notes

Wow. Just completely shocked at this performance by [[GS]Myuka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733) on [Camellia's *MI11I0N PP*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1388481#mania/2867552).

If you thought *My Man* had LNs, wait until you see a map of over 7 minutes of non-stop LN gameplay, and with not just single-note rainbows and glissandos, but an interconnected web of the two. It is an impeccable display of skill, accuracy, speed, and just what osu!monthly is looking for in a showcase!

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://youtu.be/embed/nc_ejGtZKUM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/catch.png) osu!catch

#### Galaxy brain

Somebody screeeeeam! Even while being the number one osu!catch player in the world, a play such as [YesMyDarkness](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549/fruits)' is no small feat.

Coming in with an HD HR 4xmiss on [Kurokotei's *Galaxy Collapse*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/521900#fruits/1108507) one of the most well-known artists and songs in osu! surely does do them some justice. Riddled with intense and **dash**ingly hard jumps it is a play to contend with even the hardest of maps, let alone with hidden and hardrock!

## New features in osu!(lazer)

The new client has never been so **close** to fully replace stable (although there's still a lot of work to be done on it!).

For the first time ever, lazer patch notes have been posted on the official osu! [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/osugame), compiled by [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) with further insight provided by the man himself, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2)!

Check the video out:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67P4LKlAh-0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If you are interested in all previous and future patch notes, you can find them [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog) (or just click on `Home` > `Changelog` on the top-left corner of the site).

One thing you might've missed is the new fancy Repel mod added to lazer, which is pretty chaotic but fun (finally a worthy opponent for [badeu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1473890)?)

Another feature that's maybe not the newest, but one that some of you might have missed or just haven't gotten around to trying yet, is the **skin layout editor**! First implemented in May 2021, this is still very much a work-in-progress feature, however currently you are able to edit the placement of all skin elements that appear during gameplay! Check out the showcase video from the original patch notes below:

## Monthly community quiz

For those who think they have all the answers... here's a riddle from us to you!

*Once upon a time, in the ye' old osu!, someone asked for advice from the ancestors among osu!, the post reads as follows:*

> Is it possible to repeat songs in osu!? I have an in-game video of KH2 with Roxas battling the Twilight Thorn (people who have played Kingdom Hearts 2 will be drooling) and the video is still halfway when the song ends! Or can someone at least tell me about a free, easy to use software which can solve my problem by repeating the song?

This ancient tome is hidden behind a code, the code you seek is everywhere but nowhere at the same time, always in the back of your mind but only breaching the surface at the moment you see it, now... go forth, unveil the secret code, and paste the number in the link, and gain access to this ancient tome!

The first person to answer it correctly will receive a month of osu!supporter, leave your answer in the comment!
