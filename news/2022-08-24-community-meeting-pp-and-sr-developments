Due to popular demand, the [Performance Points Committee](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/People/Performance_Points_Committee) (and associates) have decided to host a series of community meetings to address any questions or concerns you may have about the latest developments surrounding performance points and star rating!

Here's a brief rundown on how the community meetings will work:

- There will be a Q&A panel for each of the osu! gamemodes, lasting 1 - 1.5 hours each.
- These panels will be hosted on the [official osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) through a Discord stage channel.
- During each panel, audience members can raise their hand to be invited onto the stage to ask their question. Audience members can also type their questions in the relevant thread, or pre-submit their questions [here](https://forms.gle/Q3YSYZF5ZCEuqXtZ7) if they cannot attend.

Below is the schedule for the community meetings. You can tune in live through the Discord stage channel, but all talks will also be streamed live on [pending](pending link) and uploaded separately to [pending YouTube channel](pending link).
