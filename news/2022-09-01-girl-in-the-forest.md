Join us on a journey with Zetera, the Medal Hunter as he tells his story about unraveling the secret of osu!'s most elusive medal, The Girl in the Forest!

![](TBD)

Before we embark on a journey of happiness, sweat and tears, we first must learn about the history of medals. Medals were first introduced in early August 2008, with their original goal being to serve as an achievement system that could (but never did) become a part of osu!'s "story mode". The first ever medals to get added were the playcount medals and since they were retroactively given to all users that already had the needed count, some users like [Echo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/431) and [Saturos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3781) had acquired them on pretty much on release as they were playing at the time, which updated their playcount.

Soon after the playcount medals came the first batch of beatmap pack medals, and while some are not present anymore, there are some that you can still acquire! Some examples would be the [Internet Pack vol.1](https://osekai.net/medals/?medal=Internet!+Pack+vol.1), [Anime Pack vol.1](https://osekai.net/medals/?medal=Anime+Pack+vol.1), [Video Game Pack vol.1](https://osekai.net/medals/?medal=Video+Game+Pack+vol.1) and [Rhythm Game Pack vol.1](https://osekai.net/medals/?medal=Rhythm+Game+Pack+vol.1). As the game got updated, medals would become more than just a way to keep track of your pack completion with hush-hush medals. What are hush-hush medals you might ask? Well, the [osu! wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Main_Page) defined them as the following:

> Hush-Hush medals are "secret" medals awarded for pulling off very specific feats, which are not explicitly told to the player (hence the name). These feats can range anywhere from completing a beatmap under peculiar circumstances to setting a score with an unusual mod combination.

Little did anyone know that such a simple idea as "secret" medals would end up spawning a whole community surrounding medal hunting in order to acquire them all!

The history lesson is over! Let's time shift into 2017, or to be more specific, Halloween of 2017. A [new update](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-10-31-halloween-descends) just dropped for osu! and would you look at that, 9 new hush-hush medals! It has been a year since a fresh batch of hush-hush medals were added into the game (if you exclude the "Elite" medal that was added 15 days before the Halloween event) and finally, the community had something to work through and discover the solutions to. Only a week later, all of the achievements were figured out and obtained by players... well, all but one. 

A week after the Halloween update Ephemeral would go on to post the following message to the osu! forum:

>It's been roughly a week since the Halloween medal release, and just about every medal outside of one has been conclusively claimed and figured out.
Originally, I thought that the Firmament Moves would be the baffler for most people. Apparently not!
So, let's have a little fun with this, and up the ante a little bit. 

And "up the ante a little bit" he did. He would set a bounty on the medal, stating that the first person who unlocks the medal and messages him with the correct set of criteria required to unlock the medal would receive the coveted "Medal Hunter" user title.

...If you were to look at the [forum post itself]((https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/662279?n=1)) you would see that the user title was claimed in just 6 hours and you must be wondering, "why is there even an article about this?". This is where Zetera, the person who claimed the aforementioned user title comes in. I caught up with him to see what it took to figure out the correct criteria for the medal.

> I'm Zetera from Germany, I'm 24 years old and have been part of osu! for half my life. I am an ex-moderator, on-and-off contest judge, world cup commentator and a huge beatmapping nerd. And, I suppose, also a medal hunter.
