Join us for a history lesson and a story about an elusive medal and one man's journey to unravel it's secret!

![](TBD)

Before we begin with this story, we first must learn about the history of medals. Medals were first introduced in early August 2008, with their original goal being to serve as an achievement system that could (but never did) become a part of osu!'s "story mode". The first ever medals to get added were the playcount medals and since they were retroactively given to all users that already had the needed count, some users like [Echo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/431) and [Saturos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3781) had acquired them on pretty much on release as they were playing at the time, which updated their playcount and granted them the medals.

Soon after the playcount medals came the first batch of beatmap pack medals, and while some do not exist anymore, there are some that you can still acquire! Some examples would be the [Internet Pack vol.1](https://osekai.net/medals/?medal=Internet!+Pack+vol.1), [Anime Pack vol.1](https://osekai.net/medals/?medal=Anime+Pack+vol.1), [Video Game Pack vol.1](https://osekai.net/medals/?medal=Video+Game+Pack+vol.1) and [Rhythm Game Pack vol.1](https://osekai.net/medals/?medal=Rhythm+Game+Pack+vol.1). As the game got updated, medals would become more than just a way to keep track of your pack completion with hush-hush medals. What are hush-hush medals you might ask? Well, the [osu! wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Main_Page) defines them as the following:

> Hush-Hush medals are "secret" medals awarded for pulling off very specific feats, which are not explicitly told to the player (hence the name). These feats can range anywhere from completing a beatmap under peculiar circumstances to setting a score with an unusual mod combination.

Throughout the years new hush-hush medals were extremely rare, and it was only in late 2016 that medals started being released in batches after [this newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-08-17-new-hush-hush-medals) and since then would start receiving semi-regular additions.

This brings us to the main character of this story, [Zetera](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/587737). Zetera is a 24 year old osu! player from Germany, according to him osu! has been a part of half of his life and his join date certainly backs that up. In that time he has done quite a lot for the community, described in his words as such:

>I am an ex-moderator, on-and-off contest judge, world cup commentator and a huge beatmapping nerd. And, I suppose, also a medal hunter.

So how did he get into medal hunting? It was quite simple actually, he just didn't like how unobtained medals looked like on the old websites (he described them as "huge boxes with a question mark") and would rather have had those boxes show the actual hand-drawn designs than just a question mark, older players might remember them looking like this:

Every time new ones were added he'd try and find the meaning behind them and eventually built a habit out of it. Discord and the likes did not exist back in those days so a lot of time was spent hanging out on the forums, #osu and in-game DM's, with lots of players coming together and collaborating on what the solution could be.

In October of 2017 a new [Halloween themed update](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-10-31-halloween-descends) was released for osu! and 9 new hush-hush medals were added. At that point it has been a year since a fresh batch of hush-hush medals were added into the game and finally, the community had something to work through and discover the solutions to. 

Since getting batches of medals was still new, there wasn't a lot of knowledge behind what made the medal system tick, especially because the whole system was rewritten in 2016. Nowadays the community knows exactly what to look for and how extensive the system is, but back then the community's ideas were much more abstract than what was actually possible, simply because it was really hard to gauge just how precise requirements were for any given medal. The only hint that was provided was in the flavor text for the medal that is viewable once the cursor is hovered over the medal, but even that can sometimes be considered unhelpful in figuring out the solution and some have been changed multiple times over the years.

Despite all of the above, the community managed to figure out the solutions to all of the new medals! Well, all but one.. "The Girl in the Forest" stood unclaimed. Zetera and the community first deduced that the map that needed to be played was [Takuya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/342372)'s set of [Pika Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/40440#osu/128718) by [S3RL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/9). He immediately went and SS'd the map, but that didn't work. Maybe a mod was required, or the map needed to be FC'd in all game modes consecutively to get the medal, but that didn't work either. Maybe it had to be an SS? He started thinking about how the system could work, what would it look for? Surely it can't check when you lost your full combo or when an SS was lost, so the only things left would be the miss count, max combo, counts of 300s, 100s, 50s and misses, playing in different modes and a couple of other things, such as at what time was the score submitted. Looking at the flavor text it read out the following: "First Generation in more than one ways", that lead him to think that it might be Pokémon related or perhaps the first generation of influantial mappers, in the end it wasn't much of a help to him. Out of ideas, he reached out to [Ephemeral], osu!'s "community manager" (https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) and instead of receiving a hint, Ephemeral would go on to create the [following thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/662279?n=1) to the osu! forum:

>It's been roughly a week since the Halloween medal release, and just about every medal outside of one has been conclusively claimed and figured out.
Originally, I thought that the Firmament Moves would be the baffler for most people. Apparently not!
So, let's have a little fun with this, and up the ante a little bit.

And "up the ante a little bit" he did. A bounty was set on the medal, stating that the first person who unlocks the medal and messages him with the correct set of criteria required to unlock the medal would receive a "Medal Hunter" user title, which would the first of it's kind, and to this day would remain as such.

In this post he would also provide information as to how the new medal system works and what the loose criteria would be for not just The Girl in the Forest, but all medals included in the Halloween update and going forward. This led Zetera to a 5 hour madness descenting run of trial and error, he thought that maybe the max combo or accuracy needed to match numbers that were relevant to the first generation of Pokémon games. Maybe the accuracy needed to match the release date of the first game? No, the HP drain was too high to achieve a ~19% accuracy run. "How many Pokémons were in the first game" he thought, maybe I needed to get that amount of 300s, 100s and 50s.

A few minutes later he got the medal, and after sending a forum PM to Ephemeral with the correct answer, a new unique user title! He was really happy about receiving the medal, but he felt like there were other people in the community that deserved this medal more than him, he had to say this during our chat:

>User titles and I are a complicated topic. It's not really part of this interview's topic, but I did a lot of different things for the community in the hopes of leaving a mark somewhere. I became a global moderator for 3 years, hosted a tournament, commentated in a few world cups, made custom maps for tournaments, was in the select few to help kickstart moddingv2 and the loved section, was a mapping mentor and will be returning to that this year, helped with judging mapping contests, and of course participated in a lot of those, because if there was something I wanted more than anything else, it was the Elite Mapper title.
To this day I'm really envious of those that were able to achieve this prestigious title, and it's only become more and more difficult to get there. Resulting from both my efforts in the community and the many failed attempts at getting the elite mapper title, I was happy to get any user title at all. So, of course I felt elated when I actually won, but to be perfectly honest, if I had the choice, I would always elect to be an elite mapper over being a medal hunter.
Besides that, there are people in this community that deserve my user title a lot more than myself, and I strongly hope that staff considers giving out more of my title to those who actually deserve it. Even if it's just through means of competition like it was done with The Girl in the Forest, it would give the title more relevance and prestige. Heck, I keep dropping out of the 90% medals club myself.

So just to provide more context to his comment above, Zetera was a [GMT (Global Moderator)](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team) for 3 years, judged and competed in official osu! mapping contests, commented in a few of osu!'s world cups and massively contributed in the mapping community. He has been mentoring new mappers via the Mentorship program (and will be returning to it again!), helped to kickstart moddingv2 (which is a completely new system for modding beatmaps) and the loved section, which are both still up and running and massive staples of the community.

You might ask yourself what Zetera meant when he said that he kept "dropping out of the 90% medals club". Well, in 2019 the medal hunting community created [Osekai](https://osekai.net/home/), a website made for alternative rankings, in-depth profile information, medal solutions etc. On their [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/8qpNTs6 there are "clubs" that people "join" by receiving a Discord role based upon the number of medals they have. The club Zetera is referring to is the 90% medal club, which at the time of writing this currently consists of [only 44 people](https://osekai.net/rankings/?ranking=Medals&type=Users) in the entire game!

If you are interested in medal hunting definitely look into Osekai and join their Discord server, and definitely stay on the lookout for new medals as Ephemeral teased new [hush-hush](https://twitter.com/osekaiapp/status/1564610856381464580) and [beatmap pack medals](https://twitter.com/osekaiapp/status/1564871086617071616)!
Lastly, the full conversation I had with Zetera goes into much more detail about hunting medals in general, and I highly suggest you [check it out](https://gist.github.com/0x84f/5b93172d0ca1c3bf975eb8b40faa3474) if this article was interesting to you.
