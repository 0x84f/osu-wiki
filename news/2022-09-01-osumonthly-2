## lazer:
As per usual lazer has been having constant updates pushed to it, with full coverage provided on the official osu! [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/osugame). One of the updates include changes to the slider animations for osu!, which will now match the stable version of the game and hopefully remove the "weird feeling" players have reported when playing lazer.

Another great update that has been released this month is the optimization work that’s been done in order to provide the best osu! experience on a wider range of systems.

If you missed it, a post covering the work that went into the sound design of osu!(lazer) was [released on the osu! website](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-08-31-the-sound-design-of-lazer)!
The post goes in-depth about the design process of sound effects for lazer and includes snippets of an interview with [nekodex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102), the mastermind behind it all!

Boo, it’s another lazer feature showcase!
Some people say humans can only see up to 60 hz, well now you can test that yourself with the brand new **latency certifier!** Test your skills and see up to what refresh rate you can spot the difference by opening the settings and pressing on “Run latency certifier” (`General` > `Debug` > `Run latency certifier`). Feel free to let us know how far you got below, or if you are lazy you can just watch [Willy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3521482), an osu! content creator perform the test themselves!

If you are interested in all previous and future patch notes, you can find them here (or just click on `Home` > `Changelog` on the top-left corner of the site).

**The images will be stored in the shared folder of osu-wiki once done, and the icons are on osu-wiki so don't worry if it doesn't appear.**

## Community Recap
![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-09-01-osumonthly-2/collabbanner.jpg)

  You might have already seen people with similar profile pictures and banners, as it is quite common within the osu! community to have collabs between players, but have you ever seen a collab with more than a thousand participants? This is the crazy goal that [XegC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8143504) and his team have given to themselves, now entering their 7th edition since the inception of the [Endless Mirage Megacollab](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1619690?n=1)! Last time they managed to gather [3370 players](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/qgig4i/our_6th_avatar_megacollab_is_done_with_3370_users/), and they are aiming even higher this time.

  If you are interested in participating, it is quite simple: All participants, with the help of a website and completely free, can choose a different fictional character and receive their own custom avatar, userpage & forum signature banners that they can use to take part in this huge collab.
For more details feel free to join the [Endless Mirage](https://discord.gg/XXtZCZw4M6) Discord server!

## osu! "did you know" fact
osu! did not support any keyboard inputs when it was released, it was only after a suggestion was made on the forums that it was added! Another cool fact, originally you could only press circles with the space bar until a suggestion was made to have "Z" and "X" as the default bindings.
