## Starting word

As this is the second rendition of the awakened project we are still trying to find a groove and get a sense of what the community likes most and dislikes the least. If you'd like to contribute to any ideas, content, article writing, or anything else that we can feature, please don't be shy and let us know via the discussion thread on the forums or get involved in the osu!monthly process over on the [osu!dev Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ppy).
For those not caught up to speed on what osu!monthly is, osu!monthly is a reimagining of the hit-sensation osu!weekly, but in a bigger, and dare we say, the better format where, as the name implies: it is once a month, every month.
If you happened to miss out on last month's article then please check it out here! For those who were waiting ever so patiently for the next rendition, your patience is well received, but wait no longer! It! Is! Here!

## What's new in osu!(lazer)
As per usual lazer has been having weekly updates pushed to it, with full coverage provided on the official osu! [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/osugame). One of the updates include changes to the slider animations for osu!, which will now match the stable version of the game and hopefully remove the "weird feeling" players have reported when playing lazer. Furthermore, more features and fixes have been added into the editor, which will make mappers' lives easier as [Olibomby](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6573093) is implementing the features from [Mapping Tools](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/940368?n=1) into lazer!

Last, but not least, the global bindings have been reorganized for easier navigation and a lot of optimization work was done for lazer in order to provide the best osu! experience on a wider range of systems.

If you missed it, a post covering the work that went into the sound design of osu!(lazer) was [released on the osu! website](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-08-31-the-sound-design-of-lazer)!
The post goes in-depth about the design process of sound effects for lazer and includes snippets of an interview with [nekodex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102), the mastermind behind it all!

Boo, it’s another lazer feature showcase!
Some people say humans can only see up to 60 hz, well now you can test that yourself with the brand new latency certifier! Test your skills and see up to what refresh rate you can spot the difference by opening the settings and pressing on “Run latency certifier” (`General` > `Debug` > `Run latency certifier`). Feel free to let us know how far you got below, or if you are lazy you can just watch [Willy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3521482), an osu! content creator perform the test themselves!

If you are interested in all previous and future patch notes, you can find them here (or just click on `Home` > `Changelog` on the top-left corner of the site), or if you just want to listen to [pishifat]'s(https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) soothing voice speaking about lazer, you can now do that from the new [osu!(lazer) updates playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmWVQsxi34bMTmgpDArfxJ32Q0mBLhcE-).

## Community Recap

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-09-01-osumonthly-2/coebanner.jpg)

cavoe's osu! event (or COE for short) is an annual osu! convention that perfectly embodies the spirit of osu!. It is a joyous celebration for our beloved community, run by that very same community. Conceived from humble beginnings in 2017 by none other than [cavoeboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7361815) himself, it has since grown and expanded to become the international phenomenon that we know and love today.

COE 2022 took place at the Brabanthallen from Aug 1st - 7th, organised by [Meyer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5452367), cavoeboy and their incredible team of volunteer staff. Despite its return following a two year hiatus, COE 2022 saw a record-breaking 750+ attendees, attracting users from almost every continent (we'll get you next time, Antarctica). The passage of time did not go unnoticed, and a common sentiment from returning attendees was how much they "missed being here again".

Featuring over 30 hours of live stage events, COE 2022 was certainly ambitious in both range and scale. The immensely popular COE 1v1 tournament made its return, with [okinamo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3765989) being crowned the champion. In addition, COE 2022 continued to feature a large variety of Q&A panels, including a hugely technical dev talk hosted by [ThePooN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/718454) and [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2). Group activities such as Efteling and all-you-can-eat sushi were returning favourites, alongside newer entries such as Survivor and [Sotarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4452992)' Blind Music Quiz.

Of course, COE 2022 would not be complete without the collaborations of its supporting Partners. Make Some Noise's (MSN) home arcade setup and [wooz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6888206)'s arcade (WoozPC) added an impressive catalogue of music rhythm games available to experience at the venue. [Senzeeh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2489813)'s Yuki Aim also made an appearance, offering players a chance to win unique merchandise by completing difficult aim-based challenges. 

For a more grounded coverage of this exciting week, experience the event through BTMC's video <pending>

A huge thank you to Meyer for taking charge of organisation this year, alongside all other contributors that helped make this event a success.

osu!'s 15 year anniversary is coming up, and what better way to celebrate than with an [art contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-08-15-15-anniversary-art-contest)! Similar to a previously held [A Place to Belong](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/142) contest in Spring of 2022, but with a unique twist: Draw at least one of the official osu! mascots *(or community mascots)* exploring any part of osu!'s history!

By the time this monthly is released submissions will have been closed but we should see the votes coming in very soon, so be sure to cast your votes as a selection of the top voted entries will be featured within osu! (and get 3 months of supporter), and the top 3 will receive profile badges that are made using their own submission!

You might have already seen people with similar profile pictures and banners, as it is quite common within the osu! community to have collabs between players, but have you ever seen a collab with more than a thousand participants? This is the crazy goal that [XegC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8143504) and his team have given to themselves, now entering their 7th edition since the inception of the [Endless Mirage Megacollab](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1619690?n=1)! Last time they managed to gather [3370 players](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/qgig4i/our_6th_avatar_megacollab_is_done_with_3370_users/), and they are aiming even higher this time.

Entries have unfortunately closed on the 30th, but if you are interested in participating in the next edition feel free to join the [Endless Mirage Discord](https://discord.gg/XXtZCZw4M6) and grab yourself a free profile picture, forum & userpage banners!

## Did you know?
osu! did not support any keyboard inputs when it was released, it was only after a suggestion was made on the forums that it was added! Another cool fact, originally you could only press circles with the space bar until a suggestion was made to have "Z" and "X" as the default bindings.
