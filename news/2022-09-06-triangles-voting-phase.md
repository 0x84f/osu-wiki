Mark your favourite triangle-themed maps in osu!'s latest and greatest mapping + storyboarding contest!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/147/header.jpg)

[A few months ago](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-05-31-triangles), we launched a new mapping and storyboarding contest: [**triangles**](/wiki/Contests/triangles_Beatmapping_Contest), centered around osu!(lazer)'s theme song *[cYsmix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/2) - triangles*.

Last month, our [mapper panel](/wiki/Contests/triangles_Beatmapping_Contest#mapper-panel) and [storyboarder panel](/wiki/Contests/triangles_Beatmapping_Contest#storyboarder-panel) painstakingly narrowed all submissions down to the **top 8**. Now it's your turn to choose a winner!

## Vote

[**Vote for your 3 favourite maps HERE!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/147)

Before you can vote, you'll need to **play one of the triangles playlists in osu!(lazer).**

Access the playlists via the **play** menu on osu!(lazer) and filtering by **Featured Artists** in the top right corner. There's one playlist for each difficulty level (Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane/Expert).

The top entries in the vote will earn these prizes:

- **Community vote runner-up:** 3 months of osu!supporter
- **Community vote winner:** 6 months of osu!supporter + *Community Pick* profile badge

- **Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane playlist leaders:** 1 month of osu!supporter each
- **Expert playlist leader:** 1 month of osu!supporter + triangle aficionado profile badge
