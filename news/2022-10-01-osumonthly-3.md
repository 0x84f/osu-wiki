## What's new in osu!(lazer)

This month osu!(lazer) received a bunch of quality of life updates, there are actually so many of them that a list needed to be compiled:
- Various new sound effects were added
- Maps now actually update where otherwise they wouldn't in specific scenarios
- Toast notifications have been introduced and the notification design was updated
- osu!(lazer)'s internal clock system has been reworked, which means universal offset actually works now, alongside other things
- You can now nudge skin components within the skin editor using arrow keys
- Storyboard performance has been improved by up to 10%
...and much more!

The editor also received updates, such as adding slider separation after last month's introduction of slider merging. Next to that, you can now delete specific difficulties from the editor, and lastly the editor timeline now shows slider velocity properly during placement.

As for the gameplay, basic touch support has been added for osu!catch, a clicks per second counter was added as an optional skin element within the skin editor, automatic skipping intro parts of maps in multiplayer has been added as a toggle, and judgement colours have been added in the hit distribution graph on the results screen!

Do you think that osu!(lazer)'s UI is slightly too big or too small for you? Do you want the game in a different position than the center, or in a non-native size? Well fear not, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) has devised a solution for you!

By opening up the settings and heading into `Graphics` > `UI scaling`, you can change the scale of the UI to fit your needs! Furthermore, if you want your game in a non-native size or off centre, you can do that too under `Graphics` > `Screen scaling`! Check out the example video below:

Of course, we were not able to cover everything from the patch notes, so if you are interested in all previous and future patch notes, you can find them [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog), or if you'd rather watch a video digest of them check out the playlist that's embed above!

After two years the community has finally received a new batch of Hush-Hush medals along with 3 new beatmap pack medals!
The medals were officially announced via [0x84f](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724)'s [How Zetera became a Medal Hunter](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-09-09-how-zetera-became-a-medal-hunter) news post, however prior to release the Medal Hunter community has already [found all of the beatmap packs](https://twitter.com/osekaiapp/status/1564871086617071616) medals prior to the official announcement, and Ephemeral [teased 2 out of 3 new Hush-Hush medals](https://twitter.com/osekaiapp/status/1564610856381464580) in the [Medal Hunters Discord](https://discord.com/invite/8qpNTs6)!

The community managed to figure out all of the medals within 5 days of their release, with the Lightless medal giving the biggest headache and taking 4 days of non-stop searching to solve! Word on the street is that there will be more Hush-Hush medals coming soon, so if you want to join the hunt or even just participate, join the Medal Hunters Discord linked above!

## Did you know?

[LilyPichu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17679), a now prominent content creator loaned her voice to several skin creators back in the early 2010's. For example, you can check out the [Nexus Slate & Nexus Ivory](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/55948?n=1) pair of skins which include her voice in places such as the map start countdown and applause at the end of a map.

See if you can find more skins that include her voice and let us know in the comments!

## Monthly community quiz

We decided to make a small change to how the quiz works as we prepare to start writing harder questions. Starting from this month, there will be a time limit of 1 month (since the release of the news post) to answer the question, if the question is not answered by the time next month's osu!monthly is released, the reward will not be claimable anymore.
We will also be posting the answers of last month's quiz as we feel it only makes sense regardless of whether a correct answer was provided or not.

Now that that's out of the way, the question we have prepared for you is:
