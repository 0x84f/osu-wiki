## What's new in osu!(lazer)

This month osu!(lazer) received a bunch of QOL (quality of life), there is actually so many of them that we had to compile a list:
- Various new sound effects were added
- Maps now actually update where otherwise they in specific scenarios
- Toast notifications have been introduced and the notification design was updated
- osu!(lazer)'s internal clock system has been reworked, which means universal offset actually works now, along side other things
- You can now nudge skin components within the skin editor using arrow keys
- Storyboard performance has been improved by up to 10%
...and much more!

The editor also received updates, such as adding slider separating after last month's introduction of slider merging. Next to that, you can now delete specific difficulties from the editor and the editor timeline now shows slider velocity properly during placement.

As for the gameplay, basic touch support has been added for osu!catch, a clicks/second counter was added, automatic skipping intro parts of maps in multiplayer has been added as a toggle, and judgement colours have been added in the hit distribution graph on the results screen!

Do you think that osu!(lazer)'s UI is slightly too big or too small for you? Do you want the game in a different position than the center, or in a non-native size? Well fear not, peppy has devised a solution for you!

By opening up the settings and heading into `Graphics` > `UI scaling`, you can change the scale of the UI to fit your needs! Furthermore, if you want your game in a non-native size or off centre, you can do that too under `Graphics` > `Screen scaling`! Check out the example video below:

<div align="center">
    <video width="100%" controls>
        <source src="" type="video/mp4" preload="none">
    </video>
</div>

Of course, we were not able to cover everything from the patch notes, so if you are interested in all previous and future patch notes, you can find them [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog), or if you'd rather watch a video digest of them check out the playlist that's embed above!

## Community recap

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-10-01-osumonthly-3/medalsbanner.jpg)

After two years the community has finally received a new batch of medals, with 3 new beatmap pack medals and 3 new Hush-Hush medals.
The medals were officially announced via [0x84f](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724)'s [How Zetera became a Medal Hunter](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-09-09-how-zetera-became-a-medal-hunter) news post, however the Medal Hunter community has already [found all of the beatmap packs](https://twitter.com/osekaiapp/status/1564871086617071616) medals prior to the official announcement, and Ephemeral [teased 2 out of 3 new Hush-Hush medals](https://twitter.com/osekaiapp/status/1564610856381464580) in the [Medal Hunters Discord](https://discord.com/invite/8qpNTs6)!

At the time of writing 2 out of 3 Hush-Hush medals [have been found](https://twitter.com/osekaiapp/status/1568560440778653697), with the last one (Lightless) giving the community quite a headache. If you think you've got what it takes to solve this medal, or just want to participate in hunting for the last medal from the new batch, join the Medal Hunters Discord linked above!

## Did you know?

[LilyPichu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17679), a now prominent content creator loaned her voice to several skin creators back in the early 2010's. For example, you can check out the [Nexus Slate & Nexus Ivory](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/55948?n=1) pair of skins which include her voice in places such as the map start countdown and applause at the end of a map.

See if you can find more skins that include her voice and let us know in the comments!
