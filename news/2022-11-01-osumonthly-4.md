## What's new in osu!(lazer)

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zOJKWJA-vog" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It may be the spookiest month of the year, but the osu! dev team has stayed calm and collected and delivered an impressive amount of updates.

**Cursor smoke trails are back!** Feel free to show us your drawings in the comments, if you so please. In other news, the leaderboards are finally visible during solo play, lazer has once again received adjustments in order to match stable and make lazer "feel" the same as stable. Things such as the flashlight radius during gameplay and break periods have been adjusted, the hit object dim has been hidden as well as the approach circles once the circle has been hit. The slider ticks also received adjustments due to them showing up too late in lazer, which contributed to a different "feel" of lazer.

Thew new argon skin received several updates and has also been implemented for mania, with the aim of all game modes being supported in the near future. On the topic of skins, the "longest combo" counter has been added to the combo HUD components, so now you will be able to track your longest combo even without having the leaderboard visible.

Lots of updates occured this month for the editor, such as the addition of the updated visuals for the settings, which should roughly match the newer lazer design language. Visual updates aside, [Olibomby](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6573093) found an edgecase issue with their slider stream conversion, causing it to put the last circle at the beginning of the slider, which was incorrect. [ekrctb](https://github.com/ekrctb) contributed multiple changes to the editor, some of them being the catch editor having an adjustable height (so more fruits can be visible at the same time) and the time-based selections have been improved, meaning that no matter the speed at which you are scrolling through the editor, all objects will be selected.

One thing you might've not known is that osu!(lazer) has implemented full tablet support without any drivers necessary! This means that tablets are fully plug & play with lazer, not requiring you to download any official or 3rd party drivers in order to be able to change your aspect ratio or your area size. While osu!(lazer) does not have plugin support for tablet drivers as some 3rd party drivers do, this is currently the fastest and easiest way to set up a tablet for osu!

Set up by the [osu! University](/wiki/Community/Discord_servers/osu%21_University), the [osu! improvement month](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1649135?n=1) is a big event that stretched over the whole month of October and during many activities took place such as interviews of top players, King of the Hill, randomized squads of 8, and many others programs in order to gather the osu! community around a common project: getting better. 

In order to make this goal possible, the squad program stood out from the norm by allowing to gather 8 strangers in squads to make new friends, help each other and do activities together. Also, to motivate the participants of the event to improve and stay regular, the osu! university has set up a system of daily forms that players can fill with details of their osu! sessions, and upon submitting 10 or more of those players are entered into a raffle to win an osu! keypad. Do not hesitate to [join them on Discord](https://discord.gg/QubdHdnBVg) to follow their next events!

Perhaps you missed the interviews of top players? Don't worry, the [replays](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QhgSQeB2zDRSd-xm9lQrkmGY2wJTXvH) are here for you!

[DreamJam](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1649330?n=1) is an offline osu! meetup & tournament in Singapore, hosted by [megumic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7537133) and [_gt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8301957). The event welcomed more than 90 attendees in the Dreamcore Showroom, making it the largest osu! meetup to date in Singapore.

The event featured a Tandem King of the Hill Tournament, with the fun and challenging concept of having one person control the keyboard while the other controls the mouse or tablet. The highlight of the event, however, was a Battle Royale featuring Singapore's osu! World Cup roster, including top Singaporean players such as [GSBlank](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2312106), [Eagle5324](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11987104) and the eventual champion, [Demonical](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5447609).

It is through the theme of Halloween that the best artists of the community will compete to make the most beautiful drawing (or rather the *spookiest*). A theme that everyone knows but that allows so many possibilities can only give gorgeous creations!

By the time this monthly is published the results will already be in, so be sure to check out all the entries and congratulate the winners! By the way, you can now see all the winners' works on osu!'s main menu, so be careful not to get spooked when you connect!

### Notable osu! plays of the month

*Section written by [Pisapou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16640021)*

What happens when the #1 osu! player plays an iconic map with DT? That's what [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902/osu) showed us this month with an unbelievable HDDT FC on [Cycle Hit](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/636839#osu/1351114)!

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UphOlvleGcs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You may think that mrekk would have been satisfied with this legendary score... But no, he also made the [first HDDTHR pass](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4295194484) on the same map, and a [new miss count record](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4295747622) on [Trinity Homerun](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/881996#osu/1844019) with HDDT. In short, mrekk has not stopped proving this month that he deserves his #1.

### Notable mania plays of the month

### Notable taiko plays of the month

*Section written by [ianpep](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7699030)*

4 years ago, this map was veto'd for being impossible to FC. People at the time thought it was impossible, too hard for any player to ever achieve the FC, however they were proven wrong.

After being ranked for over 3 years, the legend them self [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349/taiko) has FC'ed [Scattered Faith](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/812539#taiko/1704294)! Being 8 minutes long, and reaching up to BPM's of 380 near the ending, this map is well deserving of its 9.07 star difficulty. Not to mention some of the 1/6th bursts as well, reaching BPM's of over 500! The replay is an amazing sight to see as well, please watch it if you have the time!

Some other notable plays this month include [shinchikuhome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3174184/taiko)'s [Chronostasis](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/842930#taiko/1763738) [DT FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/174906458), earning them 982 pp along with both #1 on the map, and #1 global! Congratulations aswell to EGTS runner-up, [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073/taiko) who also set an insane [NFHDHR SS](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/175189773) on [The Limit Does Not Exist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/420395#taiko/1028158), worth 922 pp!

### Notable catch plays of the month

*Section written by..*

## Did you know?

Since 2012 and until very recently, the longest osu! ranked map was [Armin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/105902)'s set on [The Unforgiving](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/29157#osu/156352) by Within Temptation, with a total drain time of 45 minutes. But this long kept record has been beaten recently by [Nokduro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2998248) and his osu!taiko set on [DigitalOffline0011 Hayakore Tatsumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1860299#taiko/3824509) by Hayakore Tatsumi, which contains 57 minutes of drain time.

However, if we also include loved maps, [Nana Party](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/750284#taiko/1904970) by Nanahira, mapped by [katacheh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6651672) is the longest map of osu! with a total of 178 minutes of drain time.
