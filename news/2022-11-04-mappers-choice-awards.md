## Mappers' Choice Awards 2021

The Mappers' Choice Awards (or *MCA*, as it is known in the community) is an event where mappers nominate and vote on maps and mappers for various categories in order to celebrate mapping excellence in all shapes and forms.

If you ranked any beatmap, guest difficulty, or storyboard in 2021, you're invited to help the mapping community pick the most standout maps of the year!

As with the two previous editions of MCA, there are three stages: nomination, voting, and results. See above to know when the deadlines for nomination and voting are, and when to expect the final results!

- **Nomination:** Eligible users can submit any beatmaps/storyboards or users from 2021 they feel are deserving of recognition in their respective categories.
- **Voting:** Eligible users can vote on the pool of submitted nominations.
- **Results:** Will be based off of the results of voting and feature a livestream discussing each of the winners.

## A Year In Mapping 2021
