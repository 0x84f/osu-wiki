## Community recap

### OWC 2022

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-12-01-osumonthly-5/banner-OWC.jpg)

One of the most competitive and dramatic iterations of osu! World Cup has come to an end in late November.

![](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2022/img/podium.jpg)

The top 3 of OWC 2021 have returned, but they shuffled the placings around a bit. The US team extended their title streak to five in a row, beating South Korea in a tense bracket reset. Germany keeps gathering OWC badges with a third place finish.

Everything was set for a South Korean Cinderella story. After the fifth place seeding, the Asian roster was widely regarded as one of the top teams, but was predicted to fall short on making the Grand Finals stage. Main reason: Two key members, namely [FlyingTuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078) and [Karuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8775024), have left the team and five new members were introduced. However, a new unstoppable duo with [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450) and [[Karcher]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11443437) appeared, both having an incredible year of solo and team community tournaments. The mental stability helped to win back-to-back tiebreaker fights against the North American teams Canada and surprisingly, the USA.

South Korea's opponent in winners bracket finals was Germany with captain [criller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8116659) and star player [WhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101). They have constantly "passed the eye test" with rock solid wins relying on aim and speed. But against the South Korean roster, they showed unexpected flaws on the consistency and DoubleTime picks. The Asian side used these weaknesses to their advantage and secured their Top 2 spot with a 7-3 victory. Now, the Germans would meet the US team once again — in Grand Finals losers bracket.

After a winning streak of 22 matches, the USA in lower bracket was an unusual sight. Up until their loss against South Korea, their performance looked somewhat shaky. Nevertheless, their roster — once again — turned out to be the best-scaling team in the world, beating Romania and Poland in Finals without much issue. The skillcap difference was especially displayed at Grand Finals level, as the American side nearly swept Germany to knock them out of the tournament. Even though the USA have a deep and versatile roster, [Utami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7512553), the rookie of OWC 2021, stood out as the main carry of his team.

Their dominant showing continued in Grand Finals against South Korea, landing the same result (7-1) to force the bracket reset. One more time, the team around the Korean power duo showed huge morale for a comeback, but their carry performances didn't come to fruition as the United States proceeded to win 7-4 to become champion for the fifth consecutive year.

### OliBomby's Slider Picturator

If you are at all interested in mapping on osu! you have probably already heard of [Olibomby](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6573093) and his app that makes life easier for hundreds of mappers: [Mapping Tools](https://mappingtools.github.io/). But have you seen the latest update, or the [tweet](https://twitter.com/OliBomby/status/1592941194291863553?t=TEB1KmJ9pLdquaoVT9kv-g&s=19) from OliBomby on his Twitter, revealing the Slider Picturator?

To summarize the new tool he has developed, it allows you to transform your slider into any image. You don't have to be a genius to understand all the possibilities this can offer on maps, and this is what many mappers have already started to experiment with. With each new update, OliBomby seems to push the limits of the editor (like really, create an image with a slider!), but how far will it go? Only the future will tell.

### New medals

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-12-01-osumonthly-5/medals-banner@1x.jpg)

9 new badges have appeared out of thin air this month to the delight of medal hunters and players. 3 Hush-Hush medals, 3 beatmap pack medals (1 of them being a challenge beatmap pack!) and 3 skill badges have been released. Despite the elusive nature of Hush-Hush medals, it took less than a day for the medal hunters to find the solution, which shows that the community loves this sort of content and is craving for more!

Word on the street is that there will be more Hush-Hush medals coming soon, so if you feel like joining the hunt when they come out, go check out the [Medal Hunters Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/8qpNTs6). Of course, if you feel like solving any of the Hush-Hush medals on your own — not just these new ones — they're all waiting for you.

## Did you know?

There are many [user groups](/wiki/People/The_Team#user-groups) on osu!, most often recognizable by their title or color, indicating their membership in that group.

During this month, a new group has appeared on the osu! website. Indeed, the [Beatmap Spotlight Curators team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/48) has received their own group as a means to distinguish them from regular users and provide more transparency as to who is participating is involved with the project.

Furthermore, descriptions have been added to all user groups which has also contributed to transparency and informing the players as to what the purpose of said group is, all in all a very good addition to the website.
