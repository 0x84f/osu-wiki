### OliBomby's Slider Picturator

If you are at all interested in mapping on osu! you have probably already heard of [Olibomby](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6573093) and his app that makes life easier for hundreds of mappers: [Mapping Tools](https://mappingtools.github.io/). But have you seen the latest update, or the [tweet](https://twitter.com/OliBomby/status/1592941194291863553?t=TEB1KmJ9pLdquaoVT9kv-g&s=19) from OliBomby on his Twitter, revealing the Slider Picturator?

To summarize the new tool he has developed, it allows you to transform your slider into any image. You don't have to be a genius to understand all the possibilities this can offer on maps, and this is what many mappers have already started to experiment with. With each new update, OliBomby seems to push the limits of the editor (like really, create an image with a slider!), but how far will it go? Only the future will tell.

### New medals

9 new badges have appeared out of thin air this month to the delight of medal hunters and players. 3 Hush-Hush medals, 3 beatmap pack medals (1 of them being a challenge beatmap pack!) and 3 skill badges have been released. Despite the elusive nature of Hush-Hush medals, it took less than a day for the medal hunters to find the solution, which shows that the community loves this sort of content and is craving for more!

Word on the street is that there will be more Hush-Hush medals coming soon, so if you feel like joining the hunt when they come out, go check out the [Medal Hunters Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/8qpNTs6). Of course, if you feel like solving any of the Hush-Hush medals on your own — not just these new ones — they're all waiting for you.

## Did you know?

There are many [user groups](/wiki/People/The_Team#user-groups) on osu!, most often recognizable by their title or color, indicating their membership in that group.

During this month, a new group has appeared on the osu! website. Indeed, the [Beatmap Spotlight Curators team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/48) has received their own group as a means to distinguish them from regular users and provide more transparency as to who is participating is involved with the project.

Furthermore, descriptions have been added to all user groups which has also contributed to transparency and informing the players as to what the purpose of said group is, all in all a very good addition to the website.

## Monthly community quiz

## Things to look out for in December

- A new LAN is organized next month but this time, in France! The [UTT Arena](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1661444?n=1) organized tournaments for osu! and osu!mania, so if you are interested in the French scene be sure to catch the top French players compete on the hardest maps by tuning into their livestream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/osufrlive).
