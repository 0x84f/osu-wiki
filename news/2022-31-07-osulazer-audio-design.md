Sound design is often overlooked by people whenever they use… pretty much **anything**. Sound design is an integral part to how for example, a person experiences opening a can of Coca-Cola or how a car engine sounds, both in real life and in video games. It can make or break a product, so that’s why when creating osu!lazer, peppy had to put his trust into someone he knew really well to make his vision come to life. That’s where nekodex came in.

Jamie Taylor is a full-stack engineer born in Australia, he joined the osu!team as a web developer in 2015 after peppy asked him if he was interested in helping rebuild the osu! website. He has been with the team ever since, working on various osu! related things such as the review system for beatmap modding, the chat system etc., but today he describes himself as a hybrid audio designer/developer and does not involve himself as much in the web side of things. Today we will look at his alias, **nekodex**, how he developed as an artist and became the nekodex he is today and focus on the work he’s done with osu!, more specifically, osu!lazer’s sound design.

Nekodex as an alias came to be in 2012, as Jamie had musical background while growing up, played with early music software, learned from YouTube tutorials and eventually started messing around in DAW’s (digital audio workstations) until music came out. As he was getting serious with music production peppy was preparing osu!stream (an iOS spinoff of osu that was created in 2010) for the public view, which required original music for the game. As peppy and nekodex are IRL friends and peppy knew about his music he got the chance to create some themes and tracks for osu!stream and later on got some of his own songs mapped for osu!stream as well.
He then later went on to create several official songs throughout the years that we all know and love, such as
 [welcome to osu!](https://soundcloud.com/nekodex/welcome-to-osu), [circles!](https://soundcloud.com/nekodex/circles) and [aureole](https://soundcloud.com/nekodex/aureole).

When peppy decided to start from the ground up with osu!lazer in 2016 (after trying to make osu!lazer within the stable client and figuring out such a thing would not be feasible), he wanted to not only make the game look good, but also feel good. And for that he needed an audio designer, and with nekodex already having done several amazing works for osu!, peppy approached nekodex. That meant nekodex had to design every single click, shuffle, scroll, hover. The only issue was, nekodex had no UI effects design experience AT ALL, and let me tell you, sound design in music production versus UI effects is a whole different ball game. Nekodex himself described the difference like this:

*“The main difference, in my opinion, is the time scale you have to think in - for instance, with music I'd be thinking of what emotions I'm trying to convey and how to do that, maybe tied with tension and release over multiple minutes. With sound effects I'm thinking about how to create feedback that 'feels' correct in sounds that are, at most, seconds long (with most being sub-second).”*

The creative process behind creating effects is vastly different from music creation, so I asked him to explain the thought process in general and go in detail for some specific sounds we found most satisfying (and hopefully you will too!)
When we asked him how he came up with the ideas for UI effects he said he tries to visualize it and just go off of that, but sometimes he has to ask himself a series of questions in order to narrow down how to proceed ⎯ 
*“...Do I want the effect to sound organic or synthetic? If synthetic, I reach for a synth as a starting point. Organic? Reach for some samples that have characteristics I'm after in the sound.”*
One of the sounds we found most satisfying is the slider bar used all throughout the game, have a listen below!

Nekodex describes this sound as tactile and clicky and he wanted it to be satisfying to play with, and for that he needed the sound to be short and sharp. He used one of the hover sounds as the starting point to get the initial ‘shape’ for the sounds, which he tends to do quite frequently; he will use a sound that he already made in the past as a layer in new sounds because it helps him make the sound feel cohesive, even if he can’t consciously recognize the sound being used. After that he processes the sound in a DAW by layering a bunch of synths on top of each other, which sounds straightforward but takes a lot of iterations to get the effect to sound just right. After he got a few candidate sounds he pondered on how to make the slider fun to use, and he came up with the idea of pitching shifting the effect as he drags the slider in order to give it an ‘elastic-like feel’. 

Once all the changes are made he then codes up the iteration in lazer and gives it a try himself, as a sort of pre-production test so he can see how interacting with the slider bar feels and whether the pitch shifting effect worked. A few back-and-forth’s and voila, we’ve got the sound that’s in lazer right now!
Another sound that we found particularly satisfying is the difficulty selection sound in the songs menu, the feedback is so tactile and it even sounds like two hollow wooden balls being hit by each other, it’s just so amazing!

This one was pretty simple according to him ⎯ *...it was just a woodblock sample with a bunch of processing to make it sound more (tonally) balanced and snappier. I had tried a bunch of different ideas for difficulty selection, but turns out sometimes simple is best.*

And I agree, simple really is best!
Here’s a bit of trivia for you all, can you spot what these sounds are being for? Comment down below!
