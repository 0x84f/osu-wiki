Catch up with community happenings in December's edition of osu!monthly!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/banner.jpg)

Welcome to the 6th edition of osu!monthly! December surely was a busy month with a lot of community rumbles.

If you want to contribute, feel free to reach out! The osu!monthly project is organised in the osu!dev [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy), if you have suggestions you can also contact any one of the members that actively help out with osu!monthly, and if you want to check out all of the previous editions, have a look at the [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1614314?n=1).

It seems that the end of the year brings the end of many osu! community events, the major one being tournaments. For far too long the tournament scene hasn't been well published, with the new additions from last month to this month, osu!monthly hopes this brings a favorable light on a part of the community that has been left in the dark.

We also prepared a special recap of what we believe are notable (or maybe even the best!) plays of each game mode for this year, but please bear in mind that the selections are subjective, and while everyone has a right to agree or disagree, please do not go out of your way to harrass the individuals behind the selections.

With that out of the way, let's see what happened in December!

## What's new in osu!(lazer)

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgXrhrFFClY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This month osu!(lazer) has received probably the most requested addition of all time, that being adding pp to osu!(lazer). You are now able to earn pp for all of your plays done in lazer, although currently it is being implemented via a [separate website](https://lazer.ppy.sh/home) with separate rankings. When it comes to mod customisation, currently only some mods give pp as a balance pass has not yet occurred, so please bear that in mind when you give osu!(lazer) a try.
For full details we highly recommend watching the excellent video digest by [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418).

A really cool and also very requested feature that was implemented this month is [hard links](/wiki/en/Client/Release_stream/Lazer/File_storage#via-hard-links) for your osu maps, meaning that now you will not have to effectively copy your entire maps library from stable to lazer. For more information about this particular feature either watch the latest osu!(lazer) update video above, or if you are just curious about this particular feature, you can watch that specific part of the video [here](https://youtu.be/LgXrhrFFClY?t=249).

## Community recap

### Makeship osu! plushie collab

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/makeship-x-osu/header.jpg)

Have you ever dreamed of being able to cuddle or throw the osu! cookie, pippi, or the big and strong Taikonator 3000? Well it's time to jump on the opportunity and take a look at the Makeship x osu! collaboration.

After a [small teaser](https://twitter.com/osugame/status/1600560233885339649?s=20&t=jMBRjxsv69dr1-lM2JLICQ) on Twitter, and a [subsequent giveaway](https://twitter.com/osugame/status/1601055681217384453) announcing the release of this collaboration, the osu! team has decided to bring back iconic osu! figures to life in the form of limited edition plushies. If you missed the launch of this partnership, don't hesitate to go and see the [official announcement](/news/2022-12-10-makeship-x-osu-plushies).

### COE 2023 date reveal

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/COE2023-banner.jpg)

The dates have been announced for COE 2023, one of the biggest (if not the biggest) osu! event!

The staff team have announced large changes on their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uqJNxpf), the largest of them being the event floor that will be 3 times bigger, which would mean there will be much more room for both BYOC (bring your own computer) seats and partner activities such as VR, arcades and booths such as the yuki aim booth where you could both purchase their merchandise and win prizes.

It certainly feels nice to know that the event will be held unlike the 2020 event where a lot of uncertainty was present due to both financial and pandemic related issues and we are excited to see what improvements we'll see this year!

### osu! Wrapped 2022

It's been a tradition on osu! for several years to show off your yearly stats through various tools to showcase improvement (or just to show off), and the tradition keeps going this year! [osu! Wrapped 2022](https://api.netamaru.id/osu/wrapped), a web site created by [Netamaru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1830361) allows you to share your top 10 plays, your playcount and favorite mappers of the year in a single image!

So don't hesitate to try and show your friends how much you have improved this year, or how much better you are than them!

### osu! UTT Arena Tournament 2022

![](wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/UTTArena-banner.jpg)

The French community is back in force once again this year with their osu! and osu!mania tournaments taking place at the [UTT Arena](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1661444?n=1). But what makes this tournament so special besides the fact that it is organized in LAN? It's the way the maps are chosen. There are no bans as we are used to see, but a total of 51 maps (including 12 custom maps!) divided into skillsets, of which only once can be chosen for the duration of the tournament.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Sr_KGgkvf8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

After several matches and an overwhelming victory in the final, [VROUM CV VITE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7630971) and [CharleLee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10434787) came out on top. In addition, during this event, [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905) even had the opportunity to show and share some of his wonderful gameplay.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/osu!mania-LNTournament-3.jpg)

Earlier this month, the third installation of the [osu!mania LN Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/o%21mLN/3) was concluded! For those unaware, the tournament hosted by [MashedPotato](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10494860), [Polytetral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8612061), and [_yosh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7157133) is currently the biggest, most well-known tournament centered around long notes. By the end of 2022 they concluded their biggest, most ambitious iteration, with quite the assortment of custom songs, charts, and well-tailored mappools for the enjoyment of players and viewers alike!

For those who might've missed it, don't worry! The team broadcasted most, if not all matches on [their Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osumanialive). Even earlier matches were heavily contested by all players, this includes but is not limited to [the final, championship bout](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1671582562) between [Silhoueska Elze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895) and [grillroasted](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18271627), an 80 minute non-stop battle for the 1st place. Even a full on ARG was made just to showcase [LNCryption](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1893946#mania/3902893) by the hands of [HowToPlayLN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10879600) and the rest of the team which played a huge part on all custom made charts in the pools.

With that said, congratulations to everyone who participated in and helped with the project! If you're interested in joining future tournaments, please don't be afraid to join their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/SPQtt3s).

### Notable osu! plays of the year

What better way to start this year's recap than with one, if not the best score by [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450)? An insane [FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4205034675) on [Nexta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/716079#osu/1902818) by Lapix, an extraordinary tech beatmap requiring a perfect mastery of aim and an incredible consistency. They gave us an eyeful with this almost perfect score showing us at the same time the extent of his talent.

Now this is a play that you could not miss. After almost 5 years without a single FC, [\[Karcher\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11443437) was the first to impress us with a first, then a second [FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4209503586) only two days apart, on [Yomi Yori](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461744#osu/1031991). This second play of 9 minutes, during which Karcher keeps hitting all the streams at 220bpm, can only be impressive for any osu! player. Not only did \[Karcher\] definitely prove to us his stamina and consistency are incredible, but he got to claim a mind boggling $3333 bounty!

How about moving on to a classic? [WhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101)'s 4x miss with HR on [Revolutionary Etude](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/539300#osu/1142884) definitely falls under that category, a 10.36* map asking for extraordinary aim control with cross-screen jumps at 145bpm, along with solid reading skill due to higher approach rate caused by HR. A play that definitely contributed to reaffirming the fact that WhiteCat is one of the best when it comes to aim.

How to summarise the plays of this year without talking about a score that got the "osu! pp world record" title, although only for 5 days. [aetrna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6447454)'s magnificent [HDDTHR FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4327635852) on [Ascension to Heaven](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/34348#osu/111680) worth 1357pp definitely proved that when it comes to speed, no one in the world can currently do it better than eatrna, showcasing amazing consistency on the map regardless of the fact that the streams were 300bpm. Even though aetrna wasn't extremely active this year, they still managed to leave a great mark for this year.

And to finish this recap, a play made by someone you all know because he didn't stop impressing us all throughout this year, with new plays, each one being more mind boggling than the last. One of many fantastic plays by [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902), his [1240x combo](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4342345523) on [AugoEidEs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/346104#osu/764082) definitely not only shattered the minds of every single player, but has also single-handedly shattered the skill ceiling once more as they keeps making plays that were thought to be impossible, possible.

You can view all of the plays listed in the playlist below:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLbY6YsbyBvHCxJkm5d4KKn5672r-5z3ir" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notable osu!taiko plays of the year

A little different template for the osu!taiko section this time around. For this rendition, we decided to capture the 5 most outstanding plays throughout 2022.

Usually we only showcase osu!taiko specific maps, but [Ney's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5991961) immaculate play on [The Forgotten](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/176006178), caught out attention and was one which was not easily forgotten. The score showcases some extreme 500bpm monostreams that was perfected by Ney's unique playstyle. With the map itself being 3 minutes long and only a brief moment to stop, this definitely lives up to being a play of the year.

Ney wasn't the only one to have had a specific impact on the osu!taiko community. An osu!monthly veteran [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) does it again with their HDHR SS on [The Limit Does Not Exist](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/175189773). Featuring blistering and unrelenting 280bpm streams, Grape_Tea seems to do the unsurmountable and brings the play up to the next level with HD and HR, a mod combo that is notorious for being unable to play with, let alone SS with.

A newcomer to osu!monthly: [Nurend's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9905079) NC play on [Central Nucleus](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/175579351), coming in at a whopping 9.7 stars, this map is nothing but a beast when paired with NC, featuring difficult 1/6 and 1/8 patterns that challenge even the pros. This score is made even more impressive with it being the first DT play on the map and with only 8 misses, it is no wonder why this is being showcased.

One of the most showcased players for the osu!taiko section, [shinchikuhome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3174184) returns! Though, not just in name, it is all through merit on their exhausting DT FC on [Yomi yori Kikoyu, Koukoku no Tou to Honoo no Shoujo](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/174662507). Mixing 330bpm streams with the best player in the world tends to give an explosive performance. This 5 minute behemoth of a map shows the needed finger control for the slower 1/3 sections and the insane speed needed for the intense streams that the number 1 global needs to master to defeat this monster.

For the most voted play of the year, it was decided that [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349/taiko) insane FC of [Scattered Faith](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/175098621). I mean, what else is there to say about this score? Scattered Faith is infamous in the osu!taiko community for being one of, if not, the fastest map currently ranked. Coming in at over 8 minutes long, and reaching up to 360bpm, this play is definitely deserving of its #1 finish.

You can view all of the plays listed in the playlist below:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLbY6YsbyBvHBnVWWAfpMe31kx6b95GaAa" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notable osu!catch plays of the year

Starting off the list, we find [Motion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3885626)'s play on the 1.1x speed difficulty of [Hug and Kill](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/fruits/210787391), a map infamous for the insane speed sections that very few players can even pass. Nevertheless, Motion shreds through all the speed section and almost clutches the FC, however even with his 2 misses he beat the previous best misscount by 20.

Next up we have Motion's 4 miss on the highest difficulty of [XHRONOXAPSULE](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/fruits/210576459), a map that currently sits as the ranked map with the highest star rating in the game, coming in at 10.07 stars. The scariest and toughest part of this map is definitely the end section which features 277bpm antiflow patterns, what makes this play so "special" is that he actually hit the hardest part of the map, a section that no other player had hit before, but failed at a previous, easier section, turning this play into a reverse choke. However, this isn't the play that sits in the leaderboard, since shortly after Motion would set yet another high score with better combo but 3 more misses, all located at the end of the map.

The [Shin dan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/884597#fruits/1872971) might just be the hardest map compilation in CTB history. After all, surviving through a 10.43 star map that lasts for almost 10 minutes doesn't seem like an easy feat, however, after a great community effort, [ArMa79](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4982799/fruits) claimed the first clear on this map, which in this context means, obtaining a 99% on the map. This isn't the end of the story though, as only a couple months later, Motion too would rise up to the challenge, sniping ArMa79's score in the process and setting one of the best plays of 2022.

[ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187)'s score on [Ded_ed](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1705910#fruits/3800941) is probably the most unusual and shocking play set this year, but what makes this play so interesting? From an outside perspective, this map may just look like an easy 33 second, 3 star map, but this couldn't be further from the truth. This map features an astoundingly high CS 7, combined with strange pixel patterns that requires immense precision that only become harder after applying HR. If this already sounds hard, wait until you hear that he did all of this while using flashlight, absolute madness!

When a player as good as [YesMyDarknesss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549) takes over 2000 attempts to fc a single map, you know they mean business. This play on [Palace of Melancholia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1596787#fruits/3261247) isn't just one of the best of this year, but one of the best HR scores ever performed, every single section of this map is absolutely brutal, requiring immense catcher control and consistency. However, this is not the end of the story for YesMyDarknesss, as to this very day he's still trying to get another FC on this map, but this time with HDHR, having invested yet another 1000 attempts on this quest, we wish him the best for this grind in 2023!

This honorable mention is dedicated to what might be the worst choke in CTB history, Motion's play on the [World End difficulty of Sendan Life](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1431102#fruits/3881698) shows a level of speed and control that was thought to be impossible. Motion holds combo until the very end of the map, where a chain of unfortunate misses would set an end to one of what may have been one of the greatest scores of all time, nevertheless, after a few more attempts, motion was able to submit an S rank on the map, far from the FC he wished for, but still a play worth of a mention.

### Notable osu!mania plays of the year

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="link" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Mapping recap

All year long, the mappers and people involved in mapping on osu! have not stopped doing amazing things, and this month was no exception. So we will try to summarize all the things related to mapping that happened this month as best as possible in a few sentences.

### Mapping News

#### Relief of requirements to apply for BN

A big change has taken place in the application requirements of Beatmaps Nominators. Indeed, the notion of ModScore has been totally removed (which wasa score based on the number of recent mods) from the required conditions evaluated during the application of future BNs. A way to encourage mappers and modders in the community to get involved in the ranking process by joining the BNG, now more accessible.

#### SEV handbook added to the wiki

The way in which the BNs were judged could seem incomprehensible sometimes for the general public until very recently, since the [SEV rating](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team/SEV_rating) has been added in the wiki. From the different punishable omissions, to the severity applied to each, everything is now detailed there (although in reality, SEV rating adapts to each case).

### Mapping highlight

Although, like most osu! players, you may be content with the beatmaps already installed on your computer, new extraordinary and trendy beatmaps are released every month and pass the ranked status. So we decided to add this new section to the monthly to keep you up to date with the most popular beatmaps among mappers, players and even music enthusiasts.

By the way, even if we don't mention all the beatmaps that have been ranked this month, you should know that they are all great, and worth a visit. So don't hesitate to take a look at the beatmap section of the osu! website and check out the most recent beatmaps!

#### Mighty Morphin Power Rangers by Sytho - Community's favorite

An iconic song that recalls the childhood of many of us, [Mighty Morphin Power Rangers by Alakrity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1758657) of the Power Rangers series and adapted as a set on osu! by [Sytho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4175698) has definitely been the community's favorite, either as nostalgia throwback or another set to farm for those juicy performance points. With amazing guest difficulties made by [MakiDonalds](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11610772), [Kirishima-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9234078) and [rpoj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17421591), this set has a good balance between streams and jumps, making it a pleasant map to play, and players appreciated that as shown by its amazing number of plays, reaching 400k at the end of the month.

#### Seishun Complex by \_kotachi\_ - Community's favorite

Another song that stood out this month is surely [Seishun Complex by kessoku band](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1863866) from the series Bocchi the Rock!, a manga recently adapted into anime. A song that the community liked a lot as shown in the section Popular Beatmap in which this map has remained most of the month, thanks to [\_kotachi\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4698485) and all their GDers. We can also mention [Guitar to Kodoku to Aoi Hoshi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1880007) of the same anime but mapped by [ponbot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8939857) and their GDers, and which was also very well received. Trendy song, loved by the community and mapped properly, a combo that works all the time.

#### Heathens (Magnetude Bootleg) by funny - osu!monthly Mapping Team's favorite

It's a collab we've been waiting for a long time, and my god they didn't disappoint us! Some of the best tech mappers, including [0ppInOsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12551840), [-Doodle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12337329), [enryotoki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10639122), [funny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8473573), [Halgoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4109923), [Rorupan L9](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9471638), [Sharu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5597639) and [Xarr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7262065), gathered around [Heathens (Magnetude Bootleg) by twenty one pilots](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1851103) to show us once again what they are capable of. With a lively and rhythmic song, wonderfully represented by complex but organized sliders, and a storyboard that just adds another dimension to the map, this collab definitely caught our eye!

#### Song Compilation V by Sotarks - Bonus

If you know a little bit about [Sotarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4452992), you should know that he sometimes makes songs compilations. He has recently launched his [Songs Compilation V](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1892585), but this time with a different theme, memes. With guest difficulties by [Akitoshi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4754771), [Elinor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5419324), [Nymphe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10507407), [Pepekcz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7784933) and [Reform](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3723568), Sotarks has linked fun, thanks to the songs, and seriousness, through its always excellent mapping, in a set completed by a beautiful storyboard made by [PoNo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4610047) that accompanies us throughout this journey to remind us of the memes through time.

### Mappers Highlight

Obviously, behind each set, each beatmap on osu! is a mapper and hours of work to produce this "grouping of notes" that you play. So we wanted to highlight some of the mappers that stood out from the rest this month. Keep in mind that all the mappers are doing a great job even if we only select some of them, so you should definitely check out everyone's work!

#### DeviousPanda - Best Mapper

Who has never heard of them? A mapper who will never cease to impress us with his complex rhythms and his ever so beautiful and fluid patterns. [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334) has shown us this month once again what they are capable of with their two new ranked maps: [Kyu-kurarin by Will Stetson](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1739478) and [Crafted In Ice by Ekcle](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1868244), two excellent mapsets as conceptual as each other and always as impressive. Whether you're a mapper looking for inspiration, or a player looking for a new challenge, it's definitely worth a visit!

#### Aurorance - Rising Stars

Their first map was ranked in august but since then they have not stopped. With good quality beatmaps and cool song choices, including [Bing Chilling-ish by Tarako](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1820912), which is very appreciated by the community, and which stayed in the Popular Beatmaps section all throughout November, [Aurorance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13142180) has definitely entered the big league. With their enjoyable but far from boring mapping, Aurorance has all the chances in the world to have a bright future in mapping!

#### melleganol - Rising Stars

[melleganol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16452371) could be considered as a small mapper who ranks maps from time to time, until this December when four of their beatmaps came out of nowhere. It's with english pop or hip-hop music that they have completely created their own style and visuals, matching really well to this style of music. So by utilising their uniqueness they created a set on [sauceintherough by brakence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1885603), whose top difficulty plays continuously with sliders and slider velocity to create a beatmap that is both fun to play and very visual, not to mention the custom hitsounds that complete this set so well. With such a mastered style, melleganol can only be on the right track!

### Mapping around the community

#### Community Mentorship Program

Ever since 2016, we see this wonderful [Community Mentorship Program](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1622724?n=1) run couple of times every year, and it serves to help future mappers, modders and storyboarders to develop their talent with the help of people more experienced than them. Although the mentee applications should have been closed around the new year, we should see the Spring cycle start very soon, so stay tuned for a future newspost if you want to participate in the project as a mentor or mentee!

#### Christmas Queue

For the past 11 years, the [Christmas Queue](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1687778?n=1) has been returning every year to rank beatmaps related to Christmas during this festive period, and this year is no exception! For those who don't know what it is, it's a modding queue that gathers a lot of mappers and modders (including BN's) from the community in order to make as many sets as possible rankable on the Christmas theme. A good tradition that encourages mappers to make Christmas music to celebrate this holiday!

#### keevy's Collab

This month on Twitter we saw [the announcement](https://twitter.com/keevyosu/status/1605231073620905986) of the end of a long project led by [keevy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10584295): a song compilation map of [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31)'s music! It is with the help of storyboarders, hitsounders, and nearly 50 mappers that this map could be created and offer to all players who try it a unique experience. It seems that keevy plans to organize other projects in the same style, so if you're interested in some mapping project, don't hesitate to [join them](https://discord.com/invite/BjWmtfAP)!

#### OMDB (osu! map database)

[OMDB (osu! map database)](https://omdb.nyahh.net/) is a new website created by [Apo11o](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9558549) in order to allow for all community members to freely express their opinions about any and all maps on osu!. Not only is it possible to rate individual maps from 1 to 5, anyone can leave a comment on them and express what this map means for them. The tool can also be used to find new beatmaps with various listing options such as random or latest maps, or just looking at the most recent submitted votes on the front page. This project is still in development but the reception received so far has been positive. In short, if you want an alternative way to find and judge maps, this is your go-to place for that.

## Skinning Recap

Much to the dismay of skinners all around the globe, the bulletin was officially announced dead in late November of this year. However, after speaking to [RockRoller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8388854) we have agreed to include the recap in a smaller format as a part of osu!monthly, while still including the work of the [skinship](https://skinship.xyz/) team!

So without further ado, let's jump straight into it.

### Skinning news

#### New mixed skins subforum

The osu! skinning forums have disallowed mixed skins almost since it's inception, which included removing the posts from the forums. Around 2 years ago it was decided that posts promoting mixed skins should be allowed, and for any authors/artists that don't like their work being included without their permission can submit a DMCA claim. This has in turn caused a lot of bloat on the skinning forums, causing a huge drop in traffic.

About 2 months ago, RockRoller started making huge strides internally to incorporate a better place to have all the mixed skins on the forums, without taking away views from fully original skins, the result of which has been the new [Remixed Skins](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/124) subforum, that allows for posting of said skins with the caviat that it is now the **only** place where they can be posted, and proper credits are required.

One thing worth pointing out is that the rules for the other two subforums, [Completed Skins](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/109) and [Work In Progress](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/119) skins, have remained the same, so please do keep note of that when you are submitting your skin for the osu! public to see.

### Featured skins of the month

During the month of December the skinship team saw 21 skins submitted, and they have hand picked 3 of them to showcase with the usual quality skinship videos that we have grown accustomed to:

## Did you know?

Anyone's who remotely familiar with osu! is surely aware of [Mismagius'](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048) and [ztrot's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6347) [Can't Defeat Airman](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/24313#osu/104229), one of osu!'s most played maps of all time. You might also know that there's another [Can't Defeat Airman](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/24084#osu/82033) set by [Sushi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/43108), but did you know that they were supposed to be a part of the same mapset?

That's right, originally the map by Mismagius and ztrot were supposed to be a guest difficulty on Sushi's mapset, however due to multiple reasons, some of them being that the map was considered too hard to be ranked at the time (so it would have to be [approved](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Beatmap/Category)), and Sushi felt like the guest difficulty would overshadow his entire mapset.

Thanks to [Kurboh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15243233) for providing this cool fact, you can view the sources for the fact here: [1](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/43115?n=12), [2](/wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/didyouknow-dec22.jpg)

## Monthly community quiz

Congratulations to [squidstain](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11073207) for being the first person to answer last month's question and score themselves 1 month of osu!supporter!
For anyone who missed last month's edition, the question was:

*"What turbulent seas does Bancho sail through in order to deliver your messages?"*

and the answer was: *cho.ppy.sh*. Get it, choppy as in turbulent? As terrible as this pun was, it was enough for squidstain to answer correctly and acquire themselves a free month of osu!supporter. A lot of you had very creative answers and we hope to see that level creativity continue with this month's question, courtesy of our trivia master [chromb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10238680) and one of the trivia champs themselves, squidstain:

**BYEAH (placeholder)**

When we showed this question to Ephemeral (the osu! community manager), they liked it so much both due to the difficulty and creativity, that they have decided to grace the first person to correctly answer with **3 months of osu!supporter!**

Same rules apply, you have exactly 1 month after this news post goes up (or until the next news post is up, depending on the timing) to provide a correct answer via a comment, if no correct answer is provided by that time we will reveal the answer in the next edition and the prize will no longer be claimable. Good luck!

## Things to look out for in January

- Yet another LAN tourney is on the horizon. Organized by [Zeus-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5464437) with the support of [Boğaziçi University Gaming Club (BUOK)](http://buok.boun.edu.tr/), the very first iteration of **Bosphorus Invitational** aims to gather around some of the best circle clickers within the Turkish community at the border of the magnificent Bosphorus strait where the continents meet, for an epic 1 day showdown of Turkey's best players. While the participation is invite-only, feel free to either visit the venue on the 29th or check out the tournament via the [BUOK Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/buoyunkulubu/) to keep the tabs on. See more on the details through the [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1696844), which is also [available in Turkish](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1696848)!
