## What's new in osu!(lazer)

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgXrhrFFClY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This month osu!(lazer) has received probably the most requested addition of all time, that being adding pp to osu!(lazer). You are now able to earn pp for all of your plays done in lazer, although currently it is being implemented via a [separate website](https://lazer.ppy.sh/home) with separate rankings. When it comes to mod customisation, currently only some mods give pp as a balance pass has not yet occurred, so please bear that in mind when you give osu!(lazer) a try.
For full details we highly recommend watching the excellent video digest by [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418).

A really cool and also very requested feature that was implemented this month is [hard links](/wiki/en/Client/Release_stream/Lazer/File_storage#via-hard-links) for your osu maps, meaning that now you will not have to effectively copy your entire maps library from stable to lazer. Check out the video below in order to see how you can set this up!

## Community recap

### Makeship osu! plushie collab

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/makeship-x-osu/header.jpg)

Have you ever dreamed of being able to cuddle or throw the osu! cookie, pippi, or the big and strong Taikonator 3000? Well it's time to jump on the opportunity and take a look at the Makeship x osu! collaboration.

After a [small teaser](https://twitter.com/osugame/status/1600560233885339649?s=20&t=jMBRjxsv69dr1-lM2JLICQ) on Twitter, and a [subsequent giveaway](https://twitter.com/osugame/status/1601055681217384453) announcing the release of this collaboration, the osu! team has decided to bring back iconic osu! figures to life in the form of limited edition plushies. If you missed the launch of this partnership, don't hesitate to go and see the [official announcement](/news/2022-12-10-makeship-x-osu-plushies).

### COE 2023 date reveal

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/COE2023-banner.jpg)

The dates have been announced for COE 2023, one of the biggest (if not the biggest) osu! event!

The staff team have announced large changes on their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uqJNxpf), the largest of them being the event floor that will be 3 times bigger, which would mean there will be much more room for both BYOC (bring your own computer) seats and partner activities such as VR, arcades and booths such as the yuki aim booth where you could both purchase their merchandise and win prizes.

It certainly feels nice to know that the event will be held unlike the 2020 event where a lot of uncertainty was present due to both financial and pandemic related issues and we are excited to see what improvements we'll see this year!

### osu! Wrapped 2022

It's been a tradition on osu! for several years to show off your yearly stats through various tools to showcase improvement (or just to show off), and the tradition keeps going this year! [osu! Wrapped 2022](https://api.netamaru.id/osu/wrapped), a web site created by [Netamaru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1830361) allows you to share your top 10 plays, your playcount and favorite mappers of the year in a single image!

So don't hesitate to try and show your friends how much you have improved this year, or how much better you are than them!

### osu! UTT Arena Tournament 2022

![](wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/UTTArena-banner.jpg)

The French community is back in force once again this year with their osu! and osu!mania tournaments taking place at the [UTT Arena](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1661444?n=1). But what makes this tournament so special besides the fact that it is organized in LAN? It's the way the maps are chosen. There are no bans as we are used to see, but a total of 51 maps (including 12 custom maps!) divided into skillsets, of which only once can be chosen for the duration of the tournament.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Sr_KGgkvf8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

After several matches and an overwhelming victory in the final, [VROUM CV VITE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7630971) and [CharleLee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10434787) came out on top. In addition, during this event, [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905) even had the opportunity to show and share some of his wonderful gameplay.

If you are interested in the replay of the event that was casted live, feel free to watch them on the Twitch channel [osu!fr live](https://www.twitch.tv/osufrlive).

### GST:LIVE 2022

![](wiki/Tournaments/GSTLIVE/22/img/banner.png)

This month another Singaporean LAN took place, once again organised by [megumic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7537133) and [_gt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8301957). This time, the players fought on a mappool comprised of 29 custom maps, as well as 2 commissioned songs! 8 teams participated in the live tournament, with team *we go jim* consisting of [Eagle5324](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11987104) and [Moroha29](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9182389) taking home the final prize.

If you're interested, the whole event was broadcasted on the [osusg twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/osusg), and you can find the [Twitch VOD here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1681272327), or if you just want a taste of the madness, check out this insane highlight below!

### Notable osu! plays of the month

*Section written by [Pisapou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16640021)*

What a legendary month we had! It all started on December 2nd when [aetrna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6447454) submitted a [new osu! standard pp record score](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4327635852) on [Ascension to Heaven](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/34348#osu/111680) with HDDTHR, for a total of 1356pp. For those who have been keeping up with aetrna know that this score does not come as a surprise at all with several close attempts, but nonetheless we are all happy to see this map has finally been conquered.

We all thought that the new pp record would stay in the first place for a long time, but only 6 days later, [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902), as if to reaffirm their supremacy, submitted a 1371pp score on [MariannE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/285577#osu/644971) with HDDT, which firmly secured their spot as the osu! pp record holder... for now.

## Mapping Recap

All year long, the mappers and people involved in mapping on osu! have not stopped doing amazing things, and this month was no exception. So we will try to summarize  all the things related to mapping that happened this month as best as possible in a few sentences.

### Mapping News

#### Relief of requirements to apply for BN

A big change has taken place in the application requirements of Beatmaps Nominators. Indeed, the notion of ModScore has been totally removed (which wasa score based on the number of recent mods) from the required conditions evaluated during the application of future BNs. A way to encourage mappers and modders in the community to get involved in the ranking process by joining the BNG, now more accessible.

#### SEV Handbook in the wiki

The way in which the BNs were judged could seem incomprehensible sometimes for the general public until very recently, since the [SEV rating](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team/SEV_rating) has been added in the wiki. From the different punishable omissions, to the severity applied to each, everything is now detailed there (although in reality, SEV rating adapts to each case).

### Mappings Highlight

Although, like most osu! players, you may be content with the beatmaps already installed on your computer, new extraordinary and trendy beatmaps are released every month and pass the ranked status. So we decided to add this new section to the monthly to keep you up to date with the most popular beatmaps among mappers, players and even music enthusiasts.

By the way, even if we don't mention all the beatmaps that have been ranked this month, you should know that they are all great, and worth a visit. So don't hesitate to take a look at the beatmap section of the osu! website and check out the most recent beatmaps!

#### Mighty Morphin Power Rangers by Sytho - Community's favorite

An iconic song that recalls the childhood of many of us, [Mighty Morphin Power Rangers by Alakrity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1758657) of the Power Rangers series and adapted as a set on osu! by [Sytho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4175698) has definitely been the community's favorite, either as nostalgia throwback or another set to farm for those juicy performance points. With amazing guest difficulties made by [MakiDonalds](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11610772), [Kirishima-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9234078) and [rpoj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17421591), this set has a good balance between streams and jumps, making it a pleasant map to play, and players appreciated that as shown by its amazing number of plays, reaching 400k at the end of the month.

#### Seishun Complex by \_kotachi\_ - Community's favorite

Another song that stood out this month is surely [Seishun Complex by kessoku band](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1863866) from the series Bocchi the Rock!, a manga recently adapted into anime. A song that the community liked a lot as shown in the section Popular Beatmap in which this map has remained most of the month, thanks to [\_kotachi\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4698485) and all their GDers. We can also mention [Guitar to Kodoku to Aoi Hoshi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1880007) of the same anime but mapped by [ponbot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8939857) and their GDers, and which was also very well received. Trendy song, loved by the community and mapped properly, a combo that works all the time.

#### Heathens (Magnetude Bootleg) by funny - osu!monthly Mapping Team's favorite

It's a collab we've been waiting for a long time, and my god they didn't disappoint us! Some of the best tech mappers, including [0ppInOsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12551840), [-Doodle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12337329), [enryotoki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10639122), [funny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8473573), [Halgoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4109923), [Rorupan L9](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9471638), [Sharu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5597639) and [Xarr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7262065), gathered around [Heathens (Magnetude Bootleg) by twenty one pilots](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1851103) to show us once again what they are capable of. With a lively and rhythmic song, wonderfully represented by complex but organized sliders, and a storyboard that just adds another dimension to the map, this collab definitely caught our eye!

#### Song Compilation V by Sotarks - Bonus

If you know a little bit about [Sotarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4452992), you should know that he sometimes makes songs compilations. He has recently launched his [Songs Compilation V](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1892585), but this time with a different theme, memes. With guest difficulties by [Akitoshi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4754771), [Elinor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5419324), [Nymphe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10507407), [Pepekcz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7784933) and [Reform](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3723568), Sotarks has linked fun, thanks to the songs, and seriousness, through its always excellent mapping, in a set completed by a beautiful storyboard made by [PoNo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4610047) that accompanies us throughout this journey to remind us of the memes through time.

### Mappers Highlight

Obviously, behind each set, each beatmap on osu! is a mapper and hours of work to produce this "grouping of notes" that you play. So we wanted to highlight some of the mappers that stood out from the rest this month. Keep in mind that all the mappers are doing a great job even if we only select some of them, so you should definitely check out everyone's work!

#### DeviousPanda - Best Mapper

Who has never heard of them? A mapper who will never cease to impress us with his complex rhythms and his ever so beautiful and fluid patterns. [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334) has shown us this month once again what they are capable of with their two new ranked maps: [Kyu-kurarin by Will Stetson](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1739478) and [Crafted In Ice by Ekcle](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1868244), two excellent mapsets as conceptual as each other and always as impressive. Whether you're a mapper looking for inspiration, or a player looking for a new challenge, it's definitely worth a visit!

#### Aurorance - Rising Stars

Their first map was ranked in august but since then they have not stopped. With good quality beatmaps and cool song choices, including [Bing Chilling-ish by Tarako](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1820912), which is very appreciated by the community, and which stayed in the Popular Beatmaps section all throughout November, [Aurorance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13142180) has definitely entered the big league. With their enjoyable but far from boring mapping, Aurorance has all the chances in the world to have a bright future in mapping!

#### melleganol - Rising Stars

[melleganol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16452371) could be considered as a small mapper who ranks maps from time to time, until this December when four of their beatmaps came out of nowhere. It's with english pop or hip-hop music that they have completely created their own style and visuals, matching really well to this style of music. So by utilising their uniqueness they created a set on [sauceintherough by brakence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1885603), whose top difficulty plays continuously with sliders and slider velocity to create a beatmap that is both fun to play and very visual, not to mention the custom hitsounds that complete this set so well. With such a mastered style, melleganol can only be on the right track!

### Mapping Around Community

#### Community Mentorship Program

Ever since 2016, we see this wonderful [Community Mentorship Program](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1622724?n=1) run couple of times every year, and it serves to help future mappers, modders and storyboarders to develop their talent with the help of people more experienced than them. Although the mentee applications should have been closed around the new year, we should see the Spring cycle start very soon, so stay tuned for a future newspost if you want to participate in the project as a mentor or mentee!

#### Christmas Queue

For the past 11 years, the [Christmas Queue](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1687778?n=1) has been returning every year to rank beatmaps related to Christmas during this festive period, and this year is no exception! For those who don't know what it is, it's a modding queue that gathers a lot of mappers and modders (including BN's) from the community in order to make as many sets as possible rankable on the Christmas theme. A good tradition that encourages mappers to make Christmas music to celebrate this holiday!

#### keevy's Collab

This month on Twitter we saw [the announcement](https://twitter.com/keevyosu/status/1605231073620905986) of the end of a long project led by [keevy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10584295): a song compilation map of [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31)'s music! It is with the help of storyboarders, hitsounders, and nearly 50 mappers that this map could be created and offer to all players who try it a unique experience. It seems that keevy plans to organize other projects in the same style, so if you're interested in some mapping project, don't hesitate to [join them](https://discord.com/invite/BjWmtfAP)!
