New year, new osu!, right? Catch up with all that's changed since last year!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-02-01-osumonthly-7/banner.jpg)

Welcome to the 7th edition of osu!monthly! It is hard to believe that it has been 7 editions, 7 months for writing for the community. While the new year brings in new changes and more excitement for the upcoming year know that if it happens in osu!, we've got it covered, though we cannot always cover everything and are always looking for content curators, writers, and osu! enthusiasts to come and help out. If you are interested or have feedback don't be shy and let us know in the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy).

The osu!monthly [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1614314?n=1) has somewhat been disbanded after a lengthy discussion in how to reduce bloat and improve readability of the newsletter, it has now been since transformed into a permanent [osu! wiki page](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/People/osu%21monthly_team) listing the "osu!monthly team" that'll be used to sign the newsletter, but don't fret, all contributors are welcome and encouraged to help.

If you'd like to look at the previous editions of osu!monthly then make sure to check out the [wiki page](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Community/osu%21monthly) that lists not only this revival, but all other editions of the infamous project.

Now that we have rambled on and on, let's check out what January had in store for us!

## What's new in osu!(lazer)

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6Y9B1pyIcw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As osu!(lazer) is getting closer and closer to what the community would consider a "full release", more people have been getting engaged with the game, submitting pull requests and reporting bugs. This has resulted in (along other things) many cool features being added, such as the dynamic BPM counter, various versions of the judgement counters and a new song progress display bar. No longer will live streamers and players alike have to download and use 3rd party plugins in order to show these details, a common trend seen in osu!(lazer)'s development.

As you are probably aware of, in December a change was made that allows for users to obtain performance points for playing maps in osu!(lazer), albeit still having separate rankings from the current game. The launch was not ideal, but there was still a huge increase in player numbers — and most importantly, a lot of feedback was given to the team. That being said, as mentioned in the video digest of the latest update, peppy is communicating with various community members in order to discuss what balance changes should be made to the game, so be on the lookout as to what future changes might bring.

January has been full of small changes that add up to a big changelog, so if you are interested in the nitty-gritty of everything that's been changed or updated, feel free to either look at the video above or [read the full changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog/lazer/2023.121.0)!

A huge feature of osu!(lazer) that's a complete game changer for people coming over from osu!(stable) is the fact that you do not need to have an osu!supporter tag in order to download maps directly, you can now do it directly from the in-game browser! You might also notice the fact that once a map is downloaded, it is automatically imported in the background (no need to press F5 anymore), and the in-game browser will show you which maps you already have!

## Community recap

### osu!stream available on Android

Back in the ancient days of 2011, [osu!stream](/wiki/osu!stream) was released onto the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/osu-stream/id436952197) on iOS, and it has been maintained up until 2020. For many years people have been asking for an Android release, but ever since the start peppy knew this would not be an enjoyable experience due to audio latency issues that were deemed inevitable at the time.

Well... 12 years later and [ThePooN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/718454) along with various open-source contributors finally made it happen! You can now [download osu!stream](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sh.ppy.osustream&pli=1) on your Android phone and enjoy custom maps along with mechanics only found on osu!stream (one example being the hold hit circle).

A few years back all the song DLC's have been made free for everyone, so everyone will get a chance to fully experience osu!stream without needing to shell out money for the later additions to the song pool. Have fun!

### GMT applications

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/gmt-generic.jpg)

After a whopping 2 years since last time, the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team) [opened up applications](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-01-19-gmt-apps-now-open for) for upcoming members last month. Specifically, they were looking for new chat moderators for languages where manpower was lacking.

The GMT is a group of community members who moderate chat, forums, beatmap discussions and also check for inappropriate user-uploaded content. New members are usually added through an internal [recommendation and nomination process](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team#how-to-be-considered).

These have already closed as of February 2nd. Good luck to all applicants!

### Bosphorus Invitational

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-02-01-osumonthly-7/bosphorus-banner.jpg)

Hosted by [Zeus-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5464437) with the help and support of the [Boğaziçi University Gaming Club (BUOK)](https://buok.boun.edu.tr/), and sponsored by [Estanbul Esports and Gaming Center](https://www.estanbulgaming.com/?lang=en), [**Bosphorus Invitational**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1696844) is a 1v1 invite-only LAN tournament organized at Boğaziçi University South Campus, located right next to the Bosphorus Strait where the event derives its name from. The tournament featured some of the best osu! players among Turkish rankings, who are invited to participate in a friendly 1v1 showdown throughout the day. Took place on 29th of January, the event featured approximately 70 attendees, all of which hyped up to cheer for their favourite participant in the tournament and enjoy the engaging atmosphere.

Congratulations to [Raikouhou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8007528) for winning the tournament, and thanks to the players for their participation! If you've missed out on the event, you may give the below video clip a glance to witness some of the fun moments recorded at the venue:

*Special thanks to [emptypudding](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11003085) for the video clip.*

In case you wish to see how the matches went on, the livestream VOD can be found on the [BUOK Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1722657266).

### Community Choice 2022 voting open

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/162/header.jpg)

Votings are now open for polls in all four game modes in order to decide the best beatmaps of the last year. They are only open until Tuesday next week, so be quick and [get your vote in](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-01-24-community-choice-2022-open)!

Profile badges will be awarded to the winners of each game mode, and finalists will get 6 months of osu!supporter. Anyone who got their beatmap ranked in 2022 will also have their vote count towards the Mappers' Favourite category, the winners of which will receive a separate badge.

Any map ranked during 2022 will automatically show up in the poll if you've played it at least once. See the [announcement news post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-01-24-community-choice-2022-open) and vote for your favourite maps!

### Ranked statistics across osu!

The [Ranked section](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=ranked) is undeniably osu!'s poster child. New players, casual users, and diehard gamers all end up coming into contact with the content featured in there, and ever since it was first introduced, it has been evolving across the years. But how has this affected the amount of content being pumped out if we were to put it into numbers across all modes? In this article we'll compare 2021's content output with last year's numbers and its potential why's!

Starting with osu!, during 2022 **18,620** difficulties were ranked across **3,406** sets for a total of **37,954** minutes of content. This is a **3.9%** increase from 2021. While it might not seem a lot, we have to realize that the Ranked Queue during this period of time was almost always full! And the small bump in the queue's size helped just a bit.

osu!taiko on the other hand, ranked **4,873** difficulties across **1,116** sets for a total increase of **37.4%** from 2021, amounting to **12,778** minutes of content. Thanks to the efforts of the Taiko NAT and BNG, they were able to pump out quite a good amount of content, with no signs of stopping in 2023!

On the other hand, osu!catch couldn't *catch* a break, having an overall increase of **0.2%** with **1,780** difficulties across **364** sets being Ranked or the equivalent of **3,593** minutes of playtime. We'd really hope that bringing these numbers up will encourage more people to help with the mode's content output.

Finally, our biggest outlier is osu!mania with **4,622** difficulties ranked across **891** sets for a MASSIVE **115.73%** increase, totalling to **12,000** minutes of content. This is *huge*. There are various reasons for this growth to have happened. Let it be a good increase in the number of BNs, recent and impactful changes to the way hitsounds and spreads are handled in the mode, or the community's proactive ness at making the mode better just to put a few examples.

We really want to thank everyone who was involved in making content for the game. It keeps it alive and well! Even just a small grain of sand can build big sand castles, and we hope for the numbers shown to put that into perspective.

Many thanks to [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) for giving us this data to work with. We hope that it is as interesting to us as it will be for you, the reader!

### Notable osu! plays of the year

2023 started off with a bang, with [lifeline](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/11367222) being the first person to [HDDT FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4356860873) the top difficulty of [No Title](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/320118#osu/714001), one of the most played maps ever. Next to that we have [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902)'s [2nd 3 mod FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4357810044) on [Wing My Way](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/46827?mode=osu), which was previously only FC'd by Adamqs (one of the greatest 3 mod players of all time). Alongside the two we have a couple of more cool plays such as the [2nd HR FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4368139903) on [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905)'s [Everything Will Freeze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/158023#osu/555797) by [MineFrostID](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12159899/), [xootynator](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3717598)'s first [HDHR FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4363537357) on [Inside the Winter Storm](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/613814#osu/1294935) and [chocomint](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/124493)'s first [HDHR FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4367683519) on [Ringing Bloom](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1066605#osu/2233275).

Check out lifeline's play on No Title below:

### Notable osu!taiko plays of the year

[shinchikuhome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3174184) strikes again! This time, being the first FC on a map considered by many to be one of the hardest maps currently ranked. This map is Nepuri's Set of [New Game Plus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/797710#taiko/1675265), a 9* map that remained un-FCed for nearly 4 and a half years, until this month. Known for its near-impossible 400BPM dense speed sections, it was recently FC'ed by shinchikuhome with a solid 97.46%, earning them #1 on the map. If you haven't seen this play before, or you want to rewatch it again, please check it out below!

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AI1OZBOkxMM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> 

Another notable play worthy of mention this month is [Majimanjiwwwww's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12337864/taiko) HDNC 1218pp play on [Aletheia (fake lover, fake summer)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1895850#taiko/3907074), earning themselves the pp record and #1 on the map! This map is notable for its 300bpm streams, only made harder with Hidden and Nightcore, making it well deserving of the new pp record. Feel free to check it out below!

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbtrG3OCdsw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Notable osu!catch plays of the year

You might be surprised to see [Yomi yori Kikoyu, Koukoku no Tou to Honoo no Shoujo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461744#fruits/1031991) in the osu!catch section, but believe it or not, this map has enjoyed great competition over the years, culminating on the play [ArMa79](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4982799) set this January. Marking the first-ever FC on this more than legendary map that's jam-packed with insane tech and precision patterns, the incredible effort put by ArMa79 to defeat one of the hardest convert maps in the game is truly admirable; however, this is not the only convert map this month, as we've seen a new DT PP record for this category of play. We are of course talking about [Aryssiel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2389481/fruits)'s 1xmiss play on [Heavy Rotation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1524839#fruits/3119805) with DT, tragically choking an even more impressive, 860pp play. To put this into context, the previous record held by [b-a-d-s123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3656717) on [Team Magma & Aqua Leader Battle Theme (Unofficial)](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/fruits/207475584) is only 724pp, we wish the best for Aryssiel if he ever tries to fix this choke.

### Notable osu!mania plays of the year


## Mapping Recap

Our team is growing, and we are trying to meet your expectations by being as objective as possible and offering content that will appeal to as many people as possible. But this section is still a work in progress, so we invite you to come and give us your opinion if you have the time! The beginning of the year has been quite productive in terms of mapping, and we'll see about that together.

If you want more official information about mapping, BNs or NAT, please go to the [Mappers Guild website](https://bn.mappersguild.com/home).

### Mappings Highlight

Like most osu! players, you may be content with the beatmaps already installed on your computer, but new extraordinary and trendy beatmaps are released every month and pass the ranked status. In this section we will keep you up to date with the most popular beatmaps among mappers & players.

By the way, even if we don't mention all the beatmaps that have been ranked this month, you should know that they are all great, so don't hesitate to take a look at the beatmap section of the osu! website and check out the most recent beatmaps!

#### Leah Kate - Life Sux (Sped Up Ver.) - Community favourite

After the great success of [10 Things I Hate About You (Sped Up & Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1881428) and [Twinkle Twinkle (Sped Up & Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1901049), [Life Sux (Sped Up Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1905234) by [Log Off Now](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4378277) was equally well received. An artist who has not been seen much in the ranked section so far and who was a real discovery, thanks to her catchy music and her beautiful voice. Beatmaps always pleasant to play no matter the situation, and new music, Log Off Now has definitely the winning wicket to please the players!

#### 15 Voices - Non-breath oblige mapped by Delis - Community favourite

If you checked Twitter even once this month (or towards the end of December), you'll have probably seen clips of the best osu! players on this map to get the best plays. We're obviously talking about [Delis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1603923)' set on [Non-breath oblige](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1889729), which was more than well received as the mind-blowing number of favourites the set showed us — reaching almost 1,800 favourites in a month thanks to the fact the mapset had a difficulty that was able to challenge all skill levels thanks to the multiple GDers in the set.

#### Pmarusama. - S'il vous President - osu!monthly Mapping Team's favorite

Are you *-w-* or *-v-* ? If you haven't understood yet, we are obviously referring to [S'il vous President](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1763440) hosted by [TtmnZk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2495509) and more particularly its Extreme difficulty by [nika mika](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3878832) with its more than amusing concepts on a lively song, with many patterns in the form of emojis, or punctuation following the song. A conceptual but still fun way to represent such a catchy song, which can be found on all the difficulties. So many reasons that made us appreciate the map and encourage you to go and have a look at it!

#### HOYO-MiX - The Stellar Moments Vol. 2 - Bonus

In organising such a huge and ambitious project, we could not fail to mention it here. Compiling almost thirty minutes of tracks from Genshin Impact, [The Stellar Moments Vol. 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1702721), a sequel to the already very popular [The Stellar Moments](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1588624) by [Shurelia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3807986) and with participation from ~20 mappers, is a real masterpiece. A way to link two very popular games in an original way and so well done, whether it's the excellent mapping, the perfect hitsounds, or the not too intrusive storyboard that allows you to simply hold the hand of the players throughout the experience. We really invite you to go and try it out!

### Mappers Highlight

Obviously, behind each set, each beatmap on osu! is a mapper and hours of work to produce this grouping of hit notes that you play. So we wanted to put here some of the mappers that stood out from the rest this month. Keep in mind that all the mappers are doing a great job even if we only select some of them, so you should definitely check out everyone's work!

#### VINXIS - Best Mapper

VINXIS, besides being one of the most popular featured artists of osu!, the person at the head of many community projects that made osu! move forward like [Corsace](https://open.corsace.io/info), [MCA (Mapper's Choice Awards)](https://mca.corsace.io/2021/) or even the [AYI (A Year in Mapping)](https://ayim.corsace.io/2021/), is a very good mapper known by all. This month he said goodbye to the community on January 1st, erasing all his digital identities to focus on his real life, but he still left us 6 maps that were ranked this month and that are all more excellent than the others and which we urge you to check out, such as [PINK BLOOD](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1490238) or [KICK BACK (TV Size)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1864478) which has already been very positively received by the players. We obviously wish him the best and hope that people as involved as him will take over!

#### chaser01 - Rising Stars

Quite active in the ranked section since the beginning of 2022, [chaser01](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18730172) is now starting to accumulate a lot of difficulties and beatmaps. With a total of 13 beatmaps, 2 of which were ranked this month, he often renews himself by proposing beatmaps that can be both visually represented rather classic like [Sekai no Hate de](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1829057), or rather conceptual like [I Ain't Got Time!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1844850#osu/3789610), but that always represents the song so well and makes the whole thing enjoyable to play. A promising mapper that we should continue to see progress in the future with many beatmaps ranked to come!

#### KennethBBG - Rising Stars

Here is a person who is really on the rise. Until the end of 2022, [KennethBBG](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13032817) was still part of the big family of mappers with about five ranked maps, but since this January, he hasn't stopped for a second and has ranked about 6 more maps! An astronomical amount that surely required a lot of effort, but that made him jump straight into the big league with Japanese and rhythmic music like [Only you! (Short Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1853621). We hope that he will continue like this and that other people as motivated as him will do the same in the coming months!

### Mapping Around Community

Numerous projects, small or large, managed independently or by large teams, and with the aim of reaching out to the osu! mapping community, are created regularly but often have too little visibility. We will therefore try to summarize in this section the different events accomplished and to come by the community, throughout the month.

#### A Year In Mapping 2022

At the beginning of the year, this small project made by [YamYA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4470854) was much talked about because it allows a very visual way of viewing the data of maps ranked throughout 2022. In this way, [A Year In Mapping 2022](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/394c39bb-6630-4ff7-9794-6ae73b2e7d95/page/hj1uB) using the [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/) tool has made it possible to enable filters to display statistics only for certain countries or modes, often allowing mappers to see where they stand in relation to others. If you haven't had a chance to take a look yet, don't hesitate!

#### The Mappers Table

[The Mappers Table Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@themapperstablepodcast) is a group of mappers now consisting of [hanabyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8617799), [CallieCube](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7535045) and [PaRaDogi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2054596) who have this month produced the first episode of a podcast about mapping. This month's guest, [Camo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5194391) spoke with them about different topics around mapping such as their favourite maps or more complex topics such as whether fun also means good. In short, a new ambitious project by the community for mappers that we hope will be a success and will last for a long time.

#### MasterMapper 2023

Have you been looking for a serious mapping tournament for a long time but can't find one? Then hurry up and sign up for [MasterMapper 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1699534?n=1), which is accepting participants until February 4th. This tournament, now in its 3rd iteration, and hosted by [Gordon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7856835), brings together mappers of all levels (with certain criteria such as having been active recently, or having ranked maps) to compete on featured artist tracks over several months. So don't hesitate to take a look at it even if you just want to see the entries of the participants!

## Skinning Recap

### Skinning news

#### The osu! 2023 Skinning Poll

On January 16th an official poll has been opened up to the public in order to gauge their opinion on the state of skinning, both from the skinning community's perspective, but also from the entire player base. By the time this edition of osu!monthly is released the poll will have been closed, however you can still contribute [through the forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/15) if you think you have an opinion worth sharing.

#### Skin of the Year 2023 voting is now live

The skinning community has been hard at work creating new skins for others to enjoy, so we highly encourage you to check out the [news post](soon) and cast your votes!

### Featured skins of the month

As should be tradition by now, 3 skins from the month of January have been selected to be showcased on osu!monthly:

- [Skadi Arknights](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1706882?n=1) - Inspired by Skadi from *Arknights*, this skin revolves around an obvious theme while still keeping to minimalism, especially in the gameplay section
- [Pink Bean - MapleStory](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1700282?n=1) - Pink Bean from *Maplestory* is a memorable character, and this skin pays homage to both the original game and the beloved character with its style and design choices
- [5WC 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1699533?n=1) - A skin made specially for the upcoming 5 Digit World Cup 2023 Tournament. Created in the author's consistent and gorgeous design style, as well as following this year's branding for 5WC, it truly shows how much love and care the organizers put into their tourneys

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLA2Nwtxa4WMorBTgwYc7puyftc30_h1Ta" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Did you know?

The art and name for osu!stream came from a community member! In mid 2010, [Koko Ban](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/60603) on the forums would [show off their idea](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/13087?n=645) for another osu! game by posting a fan concept. The community received it really well, and when peppy decided to work on the iOS version of the game, Koko Ban was commissioned to do the full visual game design. Thanks once again to [Kurboh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15243233) for providing this cool titbit of osu! lore.

## Monthly community quiz

We admit that the last month's question was brutal, and we'll be looking into balancing the difficulty over the next few issues.
The correct answer was

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-02-01-osumonthly-7/jan23-quiz.jpg)

Anyway, on to this month's question, it's February, Valentine's Day is coming soon, so here's a nice lovely question for you all:

"*soonTM*"

Good luck to everyone, and as always there's a month of osu! supporter up for grabs to the first person to get a correct answer!

## Things to look out for in February

- The [Twin Trials mapping & storyboarding competition](/news/2023-02-01-twin-trials-contest-beatmapping-phase) has been announced, it is split into two parts to accommodate for both map creation and storyboarding, if you have not by any chance seen this on the front page, check it out now! The winners of the beatmapping and storyboarding competitions will get a chance to combine their creations and have them included with every new osu!(lazer) install!
- The [Roundtable II qualifier tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1699086?n=1) has commenced, with the best osu! players in the world battling out to be one of the two people that will get a guaranteed spot on the upcoming LAN Roundtable II tournament that will be done on in Los Angeles, CA. What makes this prize even more tempting is the fact that all travelling and living costs will be covered for the two winners!
