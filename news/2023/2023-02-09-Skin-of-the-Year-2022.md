Four score and seven years ago (that being 2007), skinning was first introduced to the then newly released EBA simulator called osu!. Ever since, a sprawling and ever so creative community has been constantly expanding and evolving, many thousands of skins have been uploaded during the past 15 years, many styles and iterations of skins have come and gone, but the community never had a "Skin of the Year" competition. Instead of taking a moment to ponder at why that is, let's instead focus on the actual voting in this first-of-a-kind skin competition!

## Voting details

All skins that have been released during 2022 and added to [the compendium](https://compendium.skinship.xyz/) are eligible to compete, **including contest & podium entries**. The top-voted entry will receive a unique profile badge based on their entry and 3 months of osu!supporter. Entries #2 – #10 will receive 1 month of osu!supporter.

You might think "why would I bother voting when the [YUGEN](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/365036?n=1) is the best?", and while that skin is really cool, we urge you to check out the sheer amount of creativity that various artists have put into their works throughout the year with **290** skins that have been submitted to the [skinning forums](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/15) and **136** skins submitted to the compendium, all of them waiting to grab your attention, and maybe even become your main skin.

If these facts managed to intrigue you enough to the point of wanting to peruse around the compendium and select the skins you like the most:

You will be able to cast your vote for **14 days** after this post goes up, with the votes closing on **23rd of February**. Hopefully that's enough time to go through the catalogue and pick your favourite.

Thanks to everyone who submitted their hard work to the compendium, and good luck!
