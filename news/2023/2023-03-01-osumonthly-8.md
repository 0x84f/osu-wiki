Need a valentine? osu!monthly's got you!

![]({{BANNER the news post banner e.g. /wiki/shared/news/2023-02-10-osumonthly-7/banner.jpg}})

Welcome to the **8th** edition of osu!monthly! It's February, the month of love, and what better way to express our love for osu! and its community than by procuring everything you may want to see? Unless, of course, you're one of those people who express their love for osu! by playing it for over 12 hours straight, in which case, carry on... no judgement here.

As always, the osu!monthly team tries to find content that you all would like to read and are generally interested about; however, we can't always catch everything, so if you want to see something in the monthly news or want to voice an opinion, please do not hesitate to let us know in the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy).

With the semantics out of the way, let's dive on in and see what February scrounged up for us!
