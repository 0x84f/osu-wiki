Need a valentine? osu!monthly's got you!

![]({{BANNER the news post banner e.g. /wiki/shared/news/2023-02-10-osumonthly-7/banner.jpg}})

Welcome to the **8th** edition of osu!monthly! It's February, the month of love, and what better way to express our love for osu! and its community than by procuring everything you may want to see? Unless, of course, you're one of those people who express their love for osu! by playing it for over 12 hours straight, in which case, carry on... no judgement here.

As always, the osu!monthly team tries to find content that you all would like to read and are generally interested about; however, we can't always catch everything, so if you want to see something in the monthly news or want to voice an opinion, please do not hesitate to let us know in the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy).

With the semantics out of the way, let's dive on in and see what February scrounged up for us!

### LeFeraille's animation

A wonderful discovery this month is [LeFeraille's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8fLmUUi8wyT4dopcIEybpA) and its great and funny animations. In particular this month, a video called ["Pippi is a tournament player"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpyaQE_J548) of 4 minutes featuring Pippi and Default, two friends playing osu! and discussing tournaments, all simmering with references and jokes. So if you have four minutes to dedicate to this little creator, don't hesitate to go and have a look at what he does!

### Notable osu! plays of the month

Notable osu! plays of the month

One milestone? Two milestones? How about three.

Once again, [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) had surprised all of us with what he could do, as he FC'd the top difficulty of [Mou Ii kai?](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/807850#osu/1695382), something that many top players attempted to do, and failed, with the closest attempt before was [aetrna's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6447454) 1 miss attempt from 2 and half years ago, and [Rimuru's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9269034) 2 misses this very same month, making it a good -- an endgame score that was set only in the beginning of the year with it's 10 stars difficulty when using HDDT and 288 BPM streams scattered across the map and finally a huge jump to end the map, you can witness it for yourself here below.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5RLfYX_KCw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

However, that's only the tip of the iceberg. Although we have had many technical 10 star fcs, mrekk is the first player to have ever achieve the 10 star difficulty perfect full combo medal without a touch device.

### Notable osu!taiko plays of the month

Taiko is well known for its high skill ceiling, with many top players clearing harder and harder songs over the years. This month, we are showing off 2 extremely difficult clears, both of which are impressive in their own ways.

This first play, set by [4_4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1152851), is a true example of showing just how far the skill (and stamina!) ceiling can be pushed in this game. The song is a 45-minute compilation of Konpaku Seriels famous "Angel" set of difficulties on their maps, known for pushing difficulty far beyond many ranked maps at the moment. [This map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/772050#taiko/1623018) features some of the hardest gameplay currently found in Taiko. Some highlights for this map include brutal speed and stream sections reaching up to 400bpm, which are still considered near impossible for players of any rank, and other difficult SV and tech sections that can put anybodies patience to the test. The play is just as impressive as it sounds, passing with much HP to spare and also with 91.80%. Enough talking though, please check out this very (long play) below!

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBQ6rvzJmiM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>

Another play that excells at showing just how far this game can be pushed is [applerss's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349/taiko) NC clear on [Scarlet Keisatsu no Ghetto Patrol 24-ji](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/981267#taiko/2053465), an already speedy map brought to its absolute limit with the speed modifier. Although the length of this map is only about a minute long, this map is still nothing to scoff at, coming in at an insane 480bpm and a star rating of 9.95*. With this play applerss once again proves to the community that he is the undesputed god in speed, please check out this record-breaking play out below!

### Notable osu!catch plays of the month

[rostld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4365562)'s FC on Asymmetry was a long time coming, as this map has seen some serious competition since it was first ranked in 2015. Even after so many tries by so many different players, this FC never happened. However, recently, a &euro;50 bounty was set for the first person to obtain a full combo, and that's exactly what rostld did, finally laying this legendary map to rest.

<!-- need to have a video of this!--->

Most of the greatest scores in the game happen in singleplayer, where a player can restart and retry as many times as they desire. However, that is not what happened this time. The player [roido](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6829103) set the first ever HD SS on [dialtone](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1935722#fruits/4000779) during an AxS 4 tournament match. The nerve control required to set a score as good as this in an environment as competitive as a tournament is truly unbelievable. If you are curious to how the match went check out the [match history](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/106811263), maybe more surprises are unveiled there.

### Notable osu!mania plays of the month

Much stuff has happened in osu!mania in the last month, but here are some of the most exceptional highlights:

· Back in early 2019, one of the most legendary scores in 4k was set by [wonder5193](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8474029) - an [SS on the top difficulty in AiAe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmlDSgNBAhM). This has stood unchallenged at the top of the leaderboard for 4 years... until now. This February [Myuka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733) popped off and grabbed the #1 on the leaderboard - even more impressively, he did it through sheer force of ratio as he missed the 100% by 3 200s. How can someone achieve such level of precision over the relentless quadstreams and longjacks? See for yourself:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube
com/embed/0ik42pbJaCU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

· This start of year has been spectacular for difficult maps in the ranked section, both in 4k and 7k - but above all of them stands [tyrcs' BEYOND](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1873425#mania/3855004). This is without a doubt the new hardest ranked mania map, replacing [STRONG 280](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1741321#mania/3559824), also by [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904) (what a guy). With only 7 passes after a month, the 276 BPM unrelentingly dense chordstreams of the top difficulty are a challenge unplayable by (almost) anyone, resulting in a short leaderboard topped by none other than [- Kura -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405), who achieved an insane 810k S rank on this behemoth. Just watch below - but don't expect to understand much:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube
com/embed/GHKBgsWN-lI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Not only that, but [- Kura -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405) also achieved the new mania pp record, getting [1474pp on Last Wish](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/mania/527179450) - and he did it mere minutes after a historic win over South Korea in the MWC Semifinals. Truly extraterrestrial.

Much more has happened in this short month, but just to shoutout a couple more plays:

· [cheewee10](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4477497) obtained a [992k FC on Leeju's SYSTEM ERROR](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/mania/527961436), the controversially ranked 10* whose original version served as the MWC Semifinals Tiebreaker.
· [CrewK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604) achieved a mad [997k SS on Ciel's true DJ MAG](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/mania/529143933), another instance of him absolutely destroying one of the hardest SV charts in the game. This one is worth seeing, even if you don't follow mania - you can find the video from his perspective [here]( PLACEHOLDER as he'll surely upload it very soon ). Special attention to the **extra special** skin!

### Mappings Highlight

We know it's impossible to agree on which beatmaps are the best and which are not, but we try to highlight the ones that are most talked about or that can appeal to the most people. However, it's normal to have a different opinion and that's why we invite you to look at all the beatmaps released recently and make your own opinion (They're all great, really, worth it)!

- [10 Things I Hate About Ai no Sukima (MIMI vs. Leah Kate)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1919786) by [Log Off Now](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4378277) - A beatmap that definitely appealed to players given the playcount and the impressive number of favourites for a short period.
- [Detonate (G2, Jeris Johnson and Yonaka)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1923526) by [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334) - A beatmap that can appeal to both players and mappers thanks to beautiful concepts and visuals.
- [HAWATARI NIOKU CENTI (TV Size) (MAXIMUM THE HORMONE)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1893971) - A beatmap that stood out by being the first TV size with a difficulty of 10\*. How hard!
- [Tokugawa Cup Noodle Kinshirei (Nene Kusanagi & NeneRobo x Mikudayo & Kagamine Len & KAITO)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1763088) - A fast and catchy beatmap that convinced us with its visuals representing so well the music giving an interesting set to play.
- [Ys VIII -SONGS COMPILATION- (Falcom Sound Team jdk)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1522485) and [Pokemon Diamond & Pearl Music Medley (Dr. Pez)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1912777) by [SaltyLucario](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6571670) - Two beatmaps of fifteen and twenty minutes each offering a unique experience. We can only honour the phenomenal work put into these two maps, which are well worth the diversions.

#### Website update makes searching for newest skins easier

The osu! website has received an update, more specifically now you can sort threads on the forums by their creation date, which should hopefully make your skin browsing experience much easier.

### Featured skins of the month

You know the drill by now. 3 skins hand-picked by the skinship team that were made in the past month will now be presented in glorious fashion for your eyes to feast on.

- [kokopium](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1728192?n=1) - Heavily inspired by Kokomi from Genshin Impact, this skin takes various elements from the game and inserts them into osu!. If you are a fan of Kokomi, or just Genshin in general, you will surely enjoy this skin.
- [M I K A](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1726217?n=1) - Staying on the topic of skins centred around characters from games, this one is made with Mika from Blue Archive being a centrepiece. Anime girls aside, the skin is heavily dominated by soft, pastel-like colours across all menus which are relaxing to look at.
- [ArtemFauna](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1716182?n=1) - This skin is based on around the VTuber called [Ceres Fauna](https://www.youtube.com/@CeresFauna), and in line with the character the skin keeps up with their theme by green hues being the dominant colour, as well as the nature theme being present both in gameplay and menus.

Check out all the skins highlighted with this showcase video below:
