![]({{BANNER the news post banner e.g. /wiki/shared/news/2023-02-10-osumonthly-7/banner.jpg}})

Welcome to the **8th** edition of osu!monthly! It's February, the month of love, and what better way to express our love for osu! and its community than by procuring everything you may want to see? Unless, of course, you're one of those people who express their love for osu! by playing it for over 12 hours straight, in which case, carry on... no judgement here.

As always, the osu!monthly team tries to find content that you all would like to read and are generally interested about; however, we can't always catch everything, so if you want to see something in the monthly news or want to voice an opinion, please do not hesitate to let us know in the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy).

With the semantics out of the way, let's dive on in and see what February scrounged up for us!

### Notable osu!taiko plays of the month

Taiko is well known for its high skill ceiling, with many top players clearing harder and harder songs over the years. This month, we are showing off 2 extremely difficult clears, both of which are impressive in their own ways.

This first play, set by [4_4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1152851), is a true example of showing just how far the skill (and stamina!) ceiling can be pushed in this game. The song is a 45-minute compilation of Konpaku Seriels famous "Angel" set of difficulties on their maps, known for pushing difficulty far beyond many ranked maps at the moment. [This map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/772050#taiko/1623018) features some of the hardest gameplay currently found in Taiko. Some highlights for this map include brutal speed and stream sections reaching up to 400bpm, which are still considered near impossible for players of any rank, and other difficult SV and tech sections that can put anybodies patience to the test. The play is just as impressive as it sounds, passing with much HP to spare and also with 91.80%. Enough talking though, please check out this very (long play) below!

Another play that excells at showing just how far this game can be pushed is [applerss's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349/taiko) NC clear on [Scarlet Keisatsu no Ghetto Patrol 24-ji](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/981267#taiko/2053465), an already speedy map brought to its absolute limit with the speed modifier. Although the length of this map is only about a minute long, this map is still nothing to scoff at, coming in at an insane 480bpm and a star rating of 9.95*. With this play applerss once again proves to the community that he is the undesputed god in speed, please check out this record-breaking play out below!

### Notable osu!catch plays of the month

[rostld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4365562)'s FC on Asymmetry was a long time coming, as this map has seen some serious competition since it was first ranked in 2015. Even after so many tries by so many different players, this FC never happened. However, recently, a â‚¬50 bounty was set for the first person to obtain a full combo, and that's exactly what rostld did, finally laying this legendary map to rest.

<!-- need to have a video of this!--->

Most of the greatest scores in the game happen in singleplayer, where a player can restart and retry as many times as they desire. However, that is not what happened this time. The player [roido](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6829103) set the first ever HD SS on [dialtone](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1935722#fruits/4000779) during an AxS 4 tournament match. The nerve control required to set a score as good as this in an environment as competitive as a tournament is truly unbelievable. If you are curious to how the match went check out the [match history](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/106811263), maybe more surprises are unveiled there.

## Mapping Recap

### Mapping News

#### Community Choice 2022: Results

Like every year, the Community Choice is held to reveal the beatmaps released this year and preferred by players and mappers in all modes. It's never too late to take a look at the [announcement news post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-02-12-community-choice-2022-results), so don't hesitate!

#### Community Contributors 2022: Elite Nominators

To honour a handful of Beatmap Nominators who have stood out in the mapping or modding community, the [Community Contributors 2022](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-02-17-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2022) was held, naming fourteen new Elites Nominators who we definitely recommend you check out.

#### Community Mentorship Program Spring 2023

The Community Mentorship Program keeps helping people over the years. So we recently saw a new [announcement news post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-02-06-p-community-mentorshiprogram-spring-2023-signups-now-open) signalling the start of a new cycle. If you want to find a mentor who will help you improve in any field, you have until March 6th to sign up!

#### New NAT additions for osu!std

The Nomination Assessment Team has expanded this month in osu!, welcoming two new members: [Dada](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119507) and [Yogurtt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2649717). We wish them good luck and to stay as long as possible!

#### Twin Trials Contest

The [Twin Trials - Beatmapping Phase](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-02-01-twin-trials-contest-beatmapping-phase) announced in early February is accepting beatmap submissions until March 15th, so if you want to participate, it's better late than never, but don't waste any more time!

### Mappings Highlight

We know it's impossible to agree on which beatmaps are the best and which are not, but we try to highlight the ones that are most talked about or that can appeal to the most people. However, it's normal to have a different opinion and that's why we invite you to look at all the beatmaps released recently and make your own opinion (They're all great, really, worth it)!

- [10 Things I Hate About Ai no Sukima (MIMI vs. Leah Kate)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1919786) by [Log Off Now](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4378277) - A beatmap that definitely appealed to players given the playcount and the impressive number of favourites for a short period.
- [Detonate (G2, Jeris Johnson and Yonaka)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1923526) by [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334) - A beatmap that can appeal to both players and mappers thanks to beautiful concepts and visuals.
- [HAWATARI NIOKU CENTI (TV Size) (MAXIMUM THE HORMONE)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1893971) - A beatmap that stood out by being the first TV size with a difficulty of 10\*. How hard!
- [Tokugawa Cup Noodle Kinshirei (Nene Kusanagi & NeneRobo x Mikudayo & Kagamine Len & KAITO)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1763088) - A fast and catchy beatmap that convinced us with its visuals representing so well the music giving an interesting set to play.
- [Ys VIII -SONGS COMPILATION- (Falcom Sound Team jdk)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1522485) and [Pokemon Diamond & Pearl Music Medley (Dr. Pez)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1912777) by [SaltyLucario](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6571670) - Two beatmaps of fifteen and twenty minutes each offering a unique experience. We can only honour the phenomenal work put into these two maps, which are well worth the diversions.
