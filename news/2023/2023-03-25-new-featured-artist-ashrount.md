**Ashrount** pounds through the doors to our Featured Artist library.

You're more familiar with **Ashrount** than you may think. While their newest productions are under the alias **Ashrount**, they also produced [Emptiness](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1210804) under the name *Xect.* for BOFU2017, and a heap of older songs under the moniker *Maverick*, like the multi-mode marathon set [Maverick - Shironaga Star Jet -aquamarine mix-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1012634).

Regardless of how you know **Ashrount**, it's clear that their songs are in a league of their own. 

Pick your favourite from the **10** listed on [**Ashrount**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/352) whenever you're ready to begin your mapping journey!

## Featured Artist release schedule

**We're returning to *one artist announcement* per week.**

We've been releasing new Featured Artists **twice per week** since September 2020, amounting to over **8,500 licensed songs** since the start of the Featured Artist program!

With this massive library (which we'd like to remind people is very possibly *the* biggest collection of licensed rhythm gaming music on the planet), the Featured Artist program has already met and gone far beyond its initial goal of providing osu! mappers with a wide variety of songs to choose from.

That library will continue to grow of course, but given its current size, we aim to take less of a *"spam as many artists as possible"* approach, and shift towards **involving the broader osu! community in Featured Artists.**

*Experimentation* is how we'll handle this going forward. We want to avoid complacency with cookie-cutter releases (...like how it's been recently), and instead make Featured Artists more fun by pairing releases with extra projects/events!

So to kick things off, next week's Featured Artist announcement will also have an accompanying livestream on [the osulive Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) where [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) (a.k.a. the dude writing this) creates a mapset from start to finish using the new artist's music. If you make a map too, it'll be reviewed on the stream as well!

...and that's all for now! To hear about what we'll be doing for releases *after that*, stay tuned. :)
