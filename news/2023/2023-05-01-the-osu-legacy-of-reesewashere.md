Before livestreaming and player YouTube channels were widespread, you could rely on only one man with a camera...

If you were even slightly engaged with the osu! community between 2015 and 2016, you must've heard of [ReeseWasHere](https://www.youtube.com/@ReeseWasHere), seen some of his YouTube videos, or at the very least heard or seen the saying "Reese get the camera!!" whenever a top player would get a nice score. If you ever saw the ["mom get the camera"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLRbZJS5A_E) meme from the Call of Duty community, Reese would be the osu! equivalent to that. So without further ado let's get into the history of this legendary community member, and see what they are up to now!

Reese originally found osu! by watching a League of Legends streamer called [BoxBox](https://www.twitch.tv/boxbox), who used to play osu! while waiting in queue for another game. He liked the fact you can play anime songs, and even without any rhythm game experience he gave it a try. After playing for a fair bit and dabbling in mapping, he realized that what he really loved doing is spectating top players, watching their streams on Twitch and sharing epic moments with the osu! community. In his own words:

> I really wanted to focus on liveplays because I wanted to capture them in the moment. I wanted it to be where you could relive the moment it happened just by watching the video, so I always incorporated Twitch chat or the ingame chat when I could. And even for those that weren't there live you could still feel like you was there by seeing people's reactions.

As if by divine intervention, the will to share amazing moments perfectly coincided with [Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493/osu)'s (now known as chocomint) comeback to osu! after being gone for years, and he was sure to capture that:

The perfect storm of the community being hyped more than ever after Cookiezi's return and Reese being in college with a lot of free time provided him with the opportunity to recording anything Cookiezi related as it happened, it seemed that he was always online and ready to record and would usually be the first person to upload a new top play from either Cookiezi or any other top player at the time.

Many iconic plays that have forever been engraved into osu! history have been captured during this period, such as the [1st ever FC on IMAGE -MATERIAL-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm-zilvu8F0), [1st ever FC on Everything will freeze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d432cQoT-c) and the [1st ever 700pp score on Blue Zenith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYNpkDrCWtA), from which "727" meme was born and still refuses to die to this day ([thanks Aireu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaAF51Gwbxo&t=72s)).

Unknowingly to him at the time, the YouTube channel was starting to turn into a time capsule of a simpler time, what some consider to be the "golden age of osu!". At the time the hype at an all-time high with fierce competition for the #1 spot, a legendary player returning & the mapping meta shifting to "pp mapping" allowing for pp records to be shattered, the community was buzzing with excitement any time people such as [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286), [Angelsim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1777162) & Cookiezi would log on and would flock to either watch their stream or spectate them in-game. Foundations were also being laid for "replay recording" YouTube channels such as [Circle People](https://www.youtube.com/@CirclePeople) that would start uploading in 2016, that would end up "competing" for subscribers, and being the first one to upload the latest plays.

But what the community didn't know is that Reese's uploads were about to come to a screeching halt.

On January 30th 2016, Reese officially announced via a now deleted [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/43c2pk/future_of_the_reesewashere_youtube_channel/) on r/osugame and a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ReeseWasHere/status/693250557419593729) that the channel will no longer be active. I asked him if there was anything else that affected his decision to quit, besides getting a full-time job:

> ...after I graduated and started working I didn't really have much time to play osu! anymore, and I especially didn't have time to record liveplays. I wasn't really into the idea of just uploading videos of replay files, and I saw other channels were filling that gap, so I just stopped uploading.

To my question of whether he still keeps up with the community, he responded that he participated in r/place last year and has kept up with the development of osu!(lazer), and is eagerly awaiting for it to be the new main client. It was suggested that he will return at some point, but that the contributions would more likely be via coding, rather than uploading videos once again.

I hope that this write-up hit older players with a wave of nostalgia as to how things used to be. I also hope that newer players had fun learning about this small, but meaningful period in osu! history, and how it has paved the way for the likes of [CPOL](https://www.youtube.com/@cpol_v1/videos) to continue carrying the torch for replay channels on YouTube.

Even though Reese is no longer holding the camera, his legacy will always live in the community in some capacity.
