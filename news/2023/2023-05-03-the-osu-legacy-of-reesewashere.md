Before livestreaming and player YouTube channels were widespread, you could rely on only one man with a camera...

If you were even slightly engaged with the osu! community between 2015 and 2016, you must've heard of [ReeseWasHere](https://www.youtube.com/@ReeseWasHere), seen some of his YouTube videos, or at the very least heard or seen the saying "Reese get the camera!!" whenever a top player would get a nice score. If you ever saw the ["mom get the camera"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLRbZJS5A_E) meme from the Call of Duty community, Reese would be the osu! equivalent to that. So without further ado let's get into the history of this legendary community member, and see what they are up to now!

Reese originally found osu! by watching a League of Legends streamer called [BoxBox](https://www.twitch.tv/boxbox), who used to play osu! while waiting in queue for another League of Legends game. Reese liked the fact you can play anime songs, and even though he never played a rhythm game before, he gave it a try. He played a fair bit and racked up 40k play count, and also dabbled in mapping a bit, but what he really loved doing is spectating top players and watching their streams on Twitch.

Reese doesn't really remember the exact reason as to *why* he started his YouTube channel, but all that he knew is that he wanted to record epic moments that would happen in the osu! community and share them with the world. In his own words:

> I really wanted to focus on liveplays because I wanted to capture them in the moment. I wanted it to be where you could relive the moment it happened just by watching the video, so I always incorporated Twitch chat or the ingame chat when I could. And even for those that weren't there live you could still feel like you was there by seeing
people's reactions.

As if by divine intervention, Reese's will to share amazing moments perfectly coincided with [Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493/osu) (now known as chocomint) coming back to osu! after being gone for years, and Reese was sure to capture that:

The perfect storm of the community being hyped more than ever after Cookiezi's return and Reese being in college with a lot of free time, he had the upper hand when it came to recording anything Cookiezi related, it seemed that he was always online and ready to record, and would usually be the first person to upload a new top play from either Cookiezi or any other top player at the time.

Reese would be present to document the Cookiezi return hype and would record iconic plays that have forever been engraved into osu! history such as the [1st ever FC on IMAGE -MATERIAL-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm-zilvu8F0), [1st ever FC on Everything will freeze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d432cQoT-c) and the [1st ever 700pp score on Blue Zenith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYNpkDrCWtA), from which "727" meme was born, and still refuses to die to this day ([thanks aireu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaAF51Gwbxo&t=72s)).

Unknowingly to him at the time, he was creating a time capsule of a simpler time, what some consider to be the "golden age of osu!". With the hype at an all-time high, fierce competition for the #1 spot, and the mapping meta shifting to "pp mapping" allowing for pp records to be shattered, the community was buzzing with excitement any time people such as [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286), [Angelsim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1777162) & Cookiezi would log on and would flock to either watch their stream or spectate them in-game. He was also laying foundations for "replay recording" YouTube channels such as Circle People that would start uploading in 2016, and would be "competing" in both subscribers, and being the first one to upload the latest plays.

But what the community didn't know is that Reese's uploads were about to come to a screeching halt.

On January 30th 2016, Reese officially announced via a now deleted [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/43c2pk/future_of_the_reesewashere_youtube_channel/) on r/osugame and a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ReeseWasHere/status/693250557419593729) that he will no longer be uploading videos to his YouTube channel due to the fact that he has finished college and has got a full time job as a frontend web developer. I asked him if there was anything else that contributed to him quitting:

> ...after I graduated and started working I didn't really have much time to play osu! anymore, and I especially didn't have time to record liveplays. I wasn't really into the idea of just uploading videos of replay files, and I saw other channels were filling that gap, so I just stopped uploading.

I asked Reese whether he still keeps up with the community, to which he responded that he participated in r/place last year and has kept up with the development of osu!(lazer), he expressed excitement for it to be the new client and how amazing it is over what we currently have. To my question of whether he would be making a comeback any time soon, he suggested that he will return at some point, but that he would rather contribute to the game via coding rather than uploading videos once again.

I hope that this write-up overwhelmed older players with a wave of nostalgia as to how things used to be. I also hope that newer players had fun learning about this small, but meaningful period in osu! history, and how it has paved the way for the likes of [CPOL](https://www.youtube.com/@cpol_v1/videos) to continue carrying the torch for replay videos on YouTube.

Even though Reese is no longer holding the camera, his legacy will always live in the community in some capacity.
