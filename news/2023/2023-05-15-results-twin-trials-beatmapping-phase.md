After months of mapping, judging, and voting, the first half of Twin Trials is coming to a close! It's time to see which duos take home the gold for every game mode.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/166/header.jpg)

[3 months ago](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-02-01-twin-trials-contest-beatmapping-phase), we launched [**Twin Trials**](/wiki/Contests/Twin_Trials_Contest), a contest with two phases: *beatmapping* and *storyboarding*, all centered around some new [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) created by one of our old-school [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) [*James Landino*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/39).

Today, the results are in.

## Beatmapping phase results

### Judging criteria

Because every submission included 5 difficulties, judging for this contest was a bit more complicated than usual.

To start, each of the 5 difficulties had its own judging category, aiming to evaluate the difficulty's overall quality. These were weighted according to each difficulty's complexity:

- **Easy** (8 points max)
- **Normal** (9 points max)
- **Hard** (10 points max)
- **Insane** (11 points max)
- **Expert** (12 points max)

On top of these, a few categories were evaluated across all difficulties. These are categories you'd find in ordinary mapping contests:

- **Musical representation** (20 points max) - How the mapset expresses the song through overall structure, patterning, and hitsounding (if relevant to the game mode)
- **Creativity** (20 points max) - How innovative the mapset is relative to other submissions and the mode's general mapping practices
- **Judges impression** (10 points max) - General impression (and anything else of note in a submission that doesn't fit a preset categories)

For the full list of prizes, check out the [Twin Trials Contest wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Twin_Trials_Contest#prizes). This includes some osu!supporter rewards for some teams that aren't listed below!

#### Judging winner

With so many veteran mappers entering **Twin Trials**, everyone knew the competition would be fierce.

On the judges' side, [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334) and [iljaaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8501291) proved they have what it takes to create 5 consistently awesome difficulties. [Their submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1971987) explored the more challenging side of what the song had to offer, while maintaining a crispy clean style throughout.

With this outcome, the two mappers have earned the profile badge below, [2 points of progress towards the *Elite Mapper* user title](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points), and their map will be used as the base for the storyboarding phase of **Twin Trials** in the soon future!

Runner-ups [acnozei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10141268) and [flake](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7627157) earned [a point of progress towards the *Elite Mapper* user title](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) too. If you're looking for an easier map than the winner, [this one](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1971997) may be worth a try!

#### Community vote winner

While judges favored [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334) and [iljaaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8501291)'s map, the wider osu! community took a different stance.

[This submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972749) by [Sylas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3906405) and [Mimari](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14339830) stood out above the rest according to the [community vote](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/166) we held with osu!(lazer)'s playlists. Only players who finished a difficulty from every submission were capable of voting, so all mapsets were considered with each vote!

That said, [Sylas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3906405) and [Mimari](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14339830) have been granted the profile badge below thanks to circle clickers like you.

![Twin Trials osu! community vote badge](https://assets.ppy.sh/profile-badges/twintrials2023-COM-STANDARD.png)

And while they're not earning major prizes, we'd like to also shout out [yf_bmp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669) and [Moecho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5075660) for making an unparalleled submission for the song [Anti Hero](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972202), which  was relatively untouched in osu! submissions. If you're looking for something completely fresh (both musically and from a mapping perspective), this is the map for you.

#### Judging & community vote winner

[![Frozen Bananas team banner](/wiki/shared/news/2023-04-17-twin-trials-beatmap-voting-open/taiko/Frozen%20Bananas.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972268)

Sitting atop the podium is [this submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972268) by legendary osu!taiko residents [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5321719) and [iceOC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5482401)! Each of them have a longstanding history in the osu!taiko community, winning tournaments left and right, and now they're here to put a mapping competition into their portfolios too!

The satisfaction of being the top scoring submission is good enough, but we'll also be rewarding both mappers their own profile badge and [2 points of progress towards the *Elite Mapper* user title](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points).

Just missing the winner's threshold was [this submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1975181) created by a not-so-conventional pairing. [Horiiizon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8071438) is an osu!taiko mapping legend, while their partner [fieryrage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3533958) dominates the osu! scene through an unmatched trio of mapping, modding, and playing capabilties.

This outcome adds yet another skill to fieryrage's collection, and further solidifies Horiiizon's already-impressive reputation. Oh, and of course, both of them have earned [a point of progress towards the *Elite Mapper* user title](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points)!

fieryrage also managed to earn *something else* from this contest, [but we'll get to that later](#twin-trials-playlist-leaders).

Sorry to those who root for the underdogs — [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) and his partner [-Rustyy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16355636) are here to take the gold in yet another mapping contest. [Their submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972145) impressed both the judges, only barely surpassing [Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565) and [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114) in almost all categories.

Jemzuu and -Rusty's efforts towards osu!catch mapping have paid off. Both have earned themselves a catch-specific profile badge and [2 points of progress towards the *Elite Mapper* user title](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points).

Neck and neck, [Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565) and [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114) narrowly took the lead from [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) and [-Rustyy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16355636) in the [community vote](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/168)!

One of osu!mania's top players is now proven to be one of osu!mania's top mappers too. [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904) and mapping veteran [richardfeder](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2446000) impressed all 5 members of the judging panel with [their 7K submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972242)!

Each mapper has been awarded their own profile badge and [2 points of progress towards the *Elite Mapper* user title](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points).

[AutotelicBrown](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4238941) and resident NAT member [Akasha-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596306) fell just short of first place with [this 4K submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972034).

In an unprecedented scenario, osu!mania's [community vote](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/169) resulted in a **3-way tie** between [BringoBrango](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10274043)/[Stability](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701738), [Hytex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8536263)/[Ucitysm](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14768693), and [MapleSyrup-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1192936)/[lenpai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5314573)! 

We've let the judges' scores act as a tiebreaker! Out of the three submissions, [this one](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972411#mania/4092859) created by [MapleSyrup-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1192936) and [lenpai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5314573) scored the highest, so they'll earn the community vote prize!

## Twin Trials playlist leaders

That'll cover the mapping results, but there's more to this contest!

To vote for this contest, we required the community to **play each of the submissions in osu!(lazer)** through one of the five difficulty-specific playlists (Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane/Expert).

As an added bonus, we also decided to reward the players at the top of each playlist with a month of osu!supporter, plus the **Twin Trials Champion profile badge** for the winner of the Expert playlist!
