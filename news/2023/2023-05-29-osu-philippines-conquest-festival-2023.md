The osu! Philippines Community is excited to announce its second (unofficial) osu! community-ran space at [CONQuest Festival 2023](https://conquestph.com), which will be held at the SMX Convention Centre in Pasay City, Philippines!

The osu! booth will have games, goodies and more as the Filipino community, players and non-players alike, get to know and enjoy osu! more!

## Tournament

The main event of the space is the **osu! Philippines Quickfire Showdown 2023**. A lineup of confirmed players will go through a LAN tournament featuring a *Super Smash Bros.*-styled Brawl format. The tournament will take place on Day 1 and Day 2, with prizes in store!

For more information about the tournament, refer to [this wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/oPQS/2).

## Booth Activties

The tournament isn't only what's in store for the community! Other activities will be there too, including a player hub for community members to meet up. Newcomers and those already familiar will also be able to play osu!lazer at the booth as well!

If you want to keep up with the event as it unfolds, but can't attend the convention, watch the live-streamed content on the [osu! Philippines Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/osuliveph).
