I like maps. You like maps. We all like maps.

For this reason, the mad scientists over at osu! labs have been synthesizing new ways to pump high-quality beatmaps directly into your bloodstream, and their latest creations are sure to excite you!

Introducing three new categories of mappack!

## Project Loved Packs:
Project Loved has been bringing some of osu!'s finest creations to your screens since 2016, and the time has come to bring some *HIGH DENSITY LOVED GOODNESS* to your songs folder. Each pack contains a selection of each season's greatest hits, as chosen by the Loved Captains themselves!

Show them some *love* over at the [Project Loved Packs Listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=loved), and perhaps even earn some medals while you're at it!

## Tournament Packs:
For years people have been asking the question, *"Where can I find a nice selection of easy-to-download mappools from past tournaments?"*. Turns out the answer has been found, as Tournament Packs are now alive and kicking! Enjoy some sensible Quarter-Final pools, or test your limits with a Grand Final pool from any of the most hype tournaments to have graced the game.
For now, the focus is on getting all of the World Cup mappools uploaded, but expect to see other tournaments joining them very soon!

Give yourself a challenge over at the [Tournament Packs Listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=tournament) today!

## Centurion Packs:
To this day there are 14 mappers who have reached the incredible milestone of reaching **one hundred** ranked maps, so after some 'light interrogation', we bring you the Centurion Packs! Each pack is made up of ten of the mapper's proudest creations, nicely packaged up into a .zip for your playing pleasure!

These packs can be found in the [Themed Packs Listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=theme)!

In addition to all of this, we would like to welcome [Shige-Tori[a]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4459449) as the new maintainer of the regular beatmap packs! (may he soon escape spreadsheet hell üôè)
