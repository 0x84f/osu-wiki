Another resident of the osu! community joins the ranks. Welcome **Krimek** to our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/371/header.jpg)

Avid osu! mapper, former player, and tournament/contest host **Krimek** has expanded their osu!-related repertoire of skills even further by producing their own twist on tons of electronic subgenres. From breakcore to hardcore to techno and to drum 'n' bass, **Krimek**'s sound covers anything an osu! player could be looking for, inspired heavily by major producers in the rhythm game scene like *Supire*, *Taishi*, and our very own [*Camellia*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31).

**15** songs make up [**Krimek**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/371), including every tune from **Krimek**'s debut album *GALAXY OF MIND/MINE*!

If you're debating whether or not to map one of **Krimek**'s tracks, gain some inspiration through SOMETHING RELATED TO THE ROUNDTABLE TBD:

Now it's time to showcase the prize-winners!

For those out of the loop, playlist leaders earn prizes based on [this cumulative leaderboard](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists#cumulative-leaderboard). More specifically, anyone with 10 total points earns their own shiny profile badge!
