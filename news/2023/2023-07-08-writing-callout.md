Ever wanted to contribute to osu!'s front page content? Now is the perfect time to do so!

![]()

After last years' efforts to spice up the front page with a variety of news posts via the [content call forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1605337?n=1), which led up to [osu!monthly](/wiki/Community/osu%21monthly) making a comeback for its [3rd season](/wiki/Community/osu%21monthly#season-3-(2022%E2%80%93present)) & a series of news posts by [0x84f](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724), we wanted to spread the word further and make contributing more accessible to the community.

Are you interested in creative writing and want to place your content in front of hundreds of thousands of players, or just have an idea that you would like to see covered on the front page? Then feel free to read below!

## Suggesting ideas

If you have an idea that you think would be a good fit for the front page, you can now submit them via this anonymous [suggestion box](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuv9heFjBX_NPDzpMvV2ORaNllHtzWKRDmk5IqSMEWvc-SNw/viewform)! Once submitted, the responses will be reviewed and ideas that are deemed fit for the front page will be posted in the ``osu-news`` channel on the [official osu! Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ppy).

## Writing for the front page

If you are keen on sharing your writing with the community, the process is incredibly simple! Again, you can join the official Discord and share your drafts in the ``osu-news`` channel, where the wiki & news contributors can evaluate your work, give feedback and help you with the process of pushing your work to the front page!

If you don't have any ideas currently, there are some already pinned in the channel which you can freely grab and work on.

While there are no prerequisites to write for the front page, having knowledge of the following will make the process easier:

- Knowledge of the Markdown language
- Basic knowledge of GitHub
- A good knowledge of the English language & its grammar

## More tournament content on the front page

For the longest time tournaments have been underrepresented on the front page, and we aim to change that going forward.

Along with the presence of the suggestion box, the wiki & news maintainers will be reaching out to tournament hosts who might be on edge about advertising their tournaments on osu!'s front page, and working with interested parties to provide coverage of said tournaments.
