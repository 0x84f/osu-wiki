Nothing's better than a brand new osu!(lazer) update on a hot summer day...

![]()

This update is **huge**, but before we go on to cover the most important bits and bobs, we are contractually obligated to let you know that osu!(lazer) is the next step in osu!'s development, and you can learn all about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut_SOreClcc).

Now that our corporate overlords are satisfied, let's jump into what this release has to offer!

### Changes

- **New notification sounds.** Thanks to [nekodex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102) getting notified in-game has never sounded so good.
- **Visual effects for hotkeys have been added to the editor.** Whenever you use a hotkey the button correlating to it will be highlighted for a brief moment, showing what action your hotkey performed.
- **Two new skinnable elements.** You can now skin the key counter and add a custom "retry" sound. That's one small step for the osu!team, one giant leap for the skinning community.
- **Gameplay bug fixes.** Some of which include fixing 1 million score being unachievable on some osu!mania maps, skin elements being flipped in osu!catch when the "Floating Fruits" mod is active, and fixing animation timing for osu!taiko.
- **New osu!taiko hitsounds for the argon skin.** Once again nekodex has blessed our ears with the sweet sounds of taiko drums.
- **Huge performance improvements.** While we won't go into the specific details, even [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) was shocked by how big the improvements are, and is eager to see what the community thinks of it.
- **OpenTabletDriver has been updated in-game.** If you didn't know, osu!(lazer) has OpenTabletDriver integrated, meaning you can adjust your tablet settings without having to leave the game or download third party drivers! With this update the game now supports more tablets, and improves support for existing tablets.

Unfortunately we were not able to cover everything that has been changed, so we highly suggest that you check out the video digest above, or if you want to look into every nook and cranny that has been changed you can do so via the [changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog/lazer/2023.621.0).
