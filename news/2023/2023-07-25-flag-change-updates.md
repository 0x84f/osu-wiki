In need of a flag change? Look no further.

The flag change process for the osu! community has been frozen since December 2021, and for the first time since then it has been resumed — with some major adjustments.

### Changes

For those who have had the necessity to request a flag change in the previous system, you may remember having to email <accounts@ppy.sh> or <support@ppy.sh> and then wait for the response, to then send another email of the information they asked for. That can be quite the journey for a flag change... that sometimes didn't fully resolve.

Well, that system has been revamped and puts *all* of the work on the user! Woohoo! No intermediary.

The new system has the flag changes right in with the account settings, also conveniently underneath the username. If the flag you possess does not match the country you are in, you'll get prompted to change it, shown in the images below.

If you have the ability to change country flags the settings will look like:

With some final words of advice, once you change your flag you cannot revert it, so make sure you are 100% certain of the change.
