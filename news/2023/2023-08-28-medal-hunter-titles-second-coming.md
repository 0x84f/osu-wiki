The legendary "**Medal Hunter**" title came back once again challenging every player to find a solution for a new medal!

[Medals](/wiki/Medals) are osu! achievements which are given for achieving certain goals, and the last batch of medals was quite exciting. On July 27th, 2023, alongside new [Hush-Hush medals](/wiki/Medals#hush-hush), [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) made a [news post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-07-27-summer-splash) in which he announced the "**Medal Hunter**" title coming back once again.

"**Medal Hunter**" is a [unique user title](/wiki/People/Users_with_unique_titles), which is given for being the first player to unlock an extremely hard to solve Hush-Hush medal. The [previous "**Medal Hunter**" title](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-09-09-how-zetera-became-a-medal-hunter) has been given out nearly **6 years ago**, which definitely made it even more interesting.

In order to obtain such a desirable title, you had to be the first player to find the solution for the **Internment** medal and unlock it. **Internment** is a Hush-Hush medal added in the last batch, being so hint-based that developers found unlocking it worth a title. Speaking of hint and sub-hint (referenced as flairs by Ephemeral), they are "Stained in the hues of madness, they rage within a four-walled jail." and "Bask in the shade of an ailing mind." respectively. And while only one player could get a shiny "**Medal Hunter**" text under their username, many still have decided to team up with others on the [Medal Hunters Discord server](https://discord.gg/8qpNTs6)!

But before we get to community's attempts to solve it, here are some details they knew from the beginning:

- The medal is only visible in osu!standard profile, so it's std-only, meaning you can't get it in other gamemodes; 
- If the medal is map-specific, meaning it can only be done on specific mapset(s) - it has to be Featured Artist song; 
- The medal is in a Hush-Hush (Expert) category, which means no [difficulty reduction mods](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#difficulty-reduction) (or [special mods](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#special)) are allowed.

Within the first few minutes of the medal releasing, players immediately noticed both hints and especially the medal icon referenced theyaremanycolors. Ever since the beginning of this medal's release, medal hunters knew the medal involved that map. From there, medal hunters were very quick to piece together that the hues from medal hint/flair are hinting at RGB to some capacity, but nobody knew in what way, and players were less focused on the subhint which ended up being the final crucial puzzle piece.

From there, medal hunters set out to find how to input various RGB values in game, but nothing seemed to be working. Red, green, and blue shows up in the video of the map, so was it dying or receiving combo up to those sections chronologically? Could it have been to do with setting certain grades back-to-back? In the default skin, D ranks are red, A ranks are green, and B ranks are blue. Could it have been to do with mods?

In the default skin, Hard Rock is red, Easy is green, but wait... Expert Hush-Hush means absolutely no difficulty reducing mods, so that couldn't be it. And while "hues of madness" seemed to be critical in figuring out the medal solution, just what in the world could "Bask in the shade of an ailing mind" mean? Medal hunters thought all of this within the first 2 days, and they were on the right track so much, that Ephemeral declared that they would not need a single hint from them. However, with no way to tell if guesses were getting closer or not to the solution, insanity only grew bigger.

The community was trying their best to *hunt* for the solution, but after an enormous number of attempts that they thought would surely work, insanity started creeping in, and hope was slowly starting to fade. *On this journey of basking in the shade of an ailing mind*, the community had received various hints. The first notable one was from Ephemeral mentioning that this medal could involve "ARG" (alternate reality game) which blasted medal hunters' sanity away even more. The possibilities seemed endless. Another hint was a video recorded by [Glassive](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12453848), one of medal hunters at [cavoe's osu! event (COE)](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event), featuring [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) himself!

The biggest hint was peppy saying the solution may need to be altered because it depends on something that could be changed in the future. The only two possibilities were osu!(lazer) and the website. For those that guessed website and thought difficulty colors, they used the hint to it's fullest extent. There was a downside to this hint though. While peppy basically confirmed this theory about difficulty colors being correct, medal hunters also got a little mislead.

After peppy said anyone, including new players would be able to get it, they started to believe it can't be performed on a difficulty higher than 4 star, which was completely wrong and resulted in community taking much more time to solve it. That subhint mentioning "Bask in the shade of an ailing mind", referring to basking in the **RGB** shades of an **Insane** diff in particular was completely ignored, because newcomers to osu! would not be able to get this medal.

With a lot of guesses and such an insane 2 hints, 1 being slightly misleading, half of medal hunters entered full Sherlock Holmes mode with the possibilities of the solution, relying more on insanity than logic and drowning the discussion threads with abominations of theories. Some were genuinely good theories that Ephemeral would take note of, and others... well, let's just say Pac-Man theory.

But, despite all the challenges the community was still determined to find the solution. One of them was [UberFazz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8646059), who was going back and forth, seeking for the way to get this medal. At first, they assumed it would be achieving 16,777,216 (256 to the 3rd power) score, because that's how many possible colors there are in RGB. Another guess of theirs was to interact with the osu! website to find a hidden message somewhere on it, which would then lead to a solution. They were also told by one of developers they had insanely close guesses multiple times, but that was just not enough...

The community was trying their best to hunt for the solution, but after an enormous number of attempts that they thought would surely work, insanity started creeping in, and hope was slowly starting to fade. 

But suddenly, after more than 3 weeks, the very last hint was dropped by [Repflez](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/201392) saying that "a message in the last 8 hours was a hint in the right direction", and after reading it, UberFazz found that message and figured exactly what they needed to do. That theory was to set scores with particular combos that relate to the RGB values of a difficulty, which UberFazz guessed was on the "celinsane" difficulty as it literally meant cell + insane just like the medal suggested. Shortly after trying this idea in regards to combo matching each value of the RGB, UberFazz successfully got **Internment** medal and received the "**Medal Hunter**" title, after more than a month since the medal's release!

After giving it more tests which crossed out grades from the equation and being celinsane diff specific, the community was finally ready to present the full solution to **Internment** medal:

On any "Insane" difficulty (4.0\* - 5.29\*) of [Frums - theyaremanycolors](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1416051#osu/3022086), set three plays in a row that have combos equal to the R, G, and B values of the difficulty indicator (on the osu! website) for the map you are playing. The possible combinations are as follows:

| Play | Combo ([vanchanicalinsane](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1416051#osu/3022086)) | Combo ([celinsane](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1533352#osu/4052455)) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 255x | 243x |
| 2nd | 104x | 76x |
| 3rd | 108x | 133x |

You also MUST get the scores back-to-back, and the third one must be a pass; If you overcombo at any point on the second or third play, fail the third play, or fail to reach the max combo requirement for the second or third score, you must restart the medal from the beginning.

And now, after it's found, UberFazz would like to give massive thanks to all those that participated in this event. They say that without the osu! medal hunting community, this would have never transpired. There were very incredibly close guesses that barely undershot the medal solution, but UberFazz was the one that made that final push and emerged as the ultimate victor for Internment and its medal hunter title.

According to Ephemeral and most of the medal hunting community, this is a masterwork of a Hush-Hush medal which sets a great example for what medals set out to be.

If you wish to entertain yourself with fun unique challenges that give you shiny medallions that show on your profile, please, by all means, consider becoming a medal hunter. Furthermore, if you do not know the solution to a medal such as this one, consider following the footsteps medal hunters must take for every new Hush-Hush medal that comes out. Ephemeral and the osu!team go out of their way to make medals the community goes crazy over. So much so, that there is a chance that the next medal batches may have medals specifically made for osu!(lazer)!

Does being a medal hunter seem like something that could spark your interest? Do you believe you can crack medals as creatively sophisticated as this one? If so, don't hesitate to give it a shot!

As a final note, we are truly grateful to every medal hunter for their contributions to solving Internment during the past month, we wouldn't have achieved it without you! Thanks and see you next time!
