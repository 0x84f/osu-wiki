The legendary "**Medal Hunter**" title came back once again challenging every player to find a solution for a new medal!

On 2023-07-27, alongside new [Hush-Hush medals](please_put_a_proper_link_here), [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) made a [newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-07-27-summer-splash) in which he announced "**Medal Hunter**" title coming back once again.
In order to obtain such a desirable title, you had to be the first player to find the solution for **Internment** medal and unlock it. And while only one player could get a shiny "**Medal Hunter**" text under their username, many still have decided to team up with others on [osu! Medal Hunters](https://discord.gg/8qpNTs6) [Discord](https://discord.com) server! 

Medal hunters were trying their best to hunt the solution, but as insanity approached and they have tried an enormous number of things that could've been it, the hope was slowly fading away. On this journey of basking in the shade of an ailing mind, the community had received various hints, including a video featuring [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) himself! 

Despite all the challenges the community was still determined to find the solution. One of them was [UberFazz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8646059), who was going back and forth, seeking for the way to get this medal. At first they assumed it would be achieving 16777216 score, because that's how many possible colors there are in RGB. Another guess of theirs was to interact with osu! website to find a hidden message somewhere on it, which would then lead to a solution. They were also told by one of developers they had insanely close guesses multiple times, but that was just not enough...

But suddenly, the very last hint was dropped, and after reading it, UberFazz figured exactly what they need to do. Shortly after trying their idea, UberFazz successfully got **Internment** medal and received the "**Medal Hunter**" title, after more than a month since medal release!

# The OG "Medal Hunter" title

Previous "**Medal Hunter**" title has been given out nearly **6 years ago**! The last time this has ever occurred was during the hunt for October of [2017’s Hush-Hush medal batch](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-10-31-halloween-descends). All the other medals were found rather fast, but **The Girl in the Forest** was left unobtained for weeks. [Zetera](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/587737), pushing for the solution, asked for a hint from [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335). That lead up to Ephemeral’s announcement of the "**Medal Hunter**" title to whoever could find its medal solution, truly igniting medal hunters on finding it. Medal hunters were confident the map was [Pika Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/40440) by [S3RL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/9), but no matter what they thought and did, the medal didn’t budge. With all medal hunters grasping at straws, trying to figure out this solution, Zetera was the one who cracked the code, applying the hints in every which way he could, eventually guessing the solution and able to explain to Ephemeral how the way he did it makes sense. 

As Ephemeral said, the fact that **The Girl in the Forest** hadn't been solved for weeks after release was outstanding to them at the time, because as people know now, it has a relatively simple hint criteria. TGF made it clear to him that there was an actual appetite for these really referential hint-style medals and that's informed a lot of design for them ever since.
