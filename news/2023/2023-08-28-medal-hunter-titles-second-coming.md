The legendary "**Medal Hunter**" title came back once again challenging every player to find a solution for a new medal!

[Medals](/wiki/Medals) are osu! achievements which are given for achieving certain goals, and the last batch of medals was quite exciting.
On 2023-07-27, alongside new [Hush-Hush medals](/wiki/Medals#hush-hush), [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) made a [news post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-07-27-summer-splash) in which he announced the "**Medal Hunter**" title coming back once again.

"**Medal Hunter**" is a [unique user title](/wiki/People/Users_with_unique_titles), which is given for being the first player to unlock an extremely hard to solve Hush-Hush medal. The [previous "**Medal Hunter**" title](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-09-09-how-zetera-became-a-medal-hunter) has been given out nearly **6 years ago**, which definitely made it even more interesting.

In order to obtain such a desirable title, you had to be the first player to find the solution for the **Internment** medal and unlock it. **Internment** is a Hush-Hush medal added in the last batch, being so hint-based that developers found unlocking it worth a title. And while only one player could get a shiny "**Medal Hunter**" text under their username, many still have decided to team up with others on the [Medal Hunters Discord server](https://discord.gg/8qpNTs6)!

The community was trying their best to *hunt* for the solution, but after an enormous number of attempts that they thought would surely work, insanity started creeping in, and hope was slowly starting to fade. *On this journey of basking in the shade of an ailing mind*, the community had received various hints, including a video recorded by one of medal hunters at [cavoe's osu! event (COE)](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event), featuring [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) himself!

Within the first few days of the medal releasing, medal hunters were very quick to piece together that the hues were hinting at RGB to some capacity, but nobody knew in what way. From there, medal hunters set out to find how to input various RGB values in game, but nothing seemed to be working. In the worst of medal hunters' struggles, half of them entered full Sherlock Holmes mode during the 2nd week of the hunt, relying more on insanity than logic and drowning the discussion threads with abominations of theories. Some were genuinely good theories that Ephemeral would take note of, and others... well, let's just say Pac-Man theory.

But, despite all the challenges the community was still determined to find the solution. One of them was [UberFazz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8646059), who was going back and forth, seeking for the way to get this medal. At first they assumed it would be achieving 16,777,216 score, because that's how many possible colors there are in RGB. Another guess of theirs was to interact with osu! website to find a hidden message somewhere on it, which would then lead to a solution. They were also told by one of developers they had insanely close guesses multiple times, but that was just not enough...

But suddenly, the very last hint was dropped, and after reading it, UberFazz figured exactly what they need to do. Shortly after trying their idea, UberFazz successfully got **Internment** medal and received the "**Medal Hunter**" title, after more than a month since the medal's release!

UberFazz would like to give massive thanks to all those that participated in this event. They say that without the osu! medal hunting community, this would have never transpired. There were very incredibly close guesses that barely undershot the medal solution, but UberFazz was the one that made that final push and emerged as the ultimate victor for Internment and its medal hunter title.

According to Ephemeral and most of the medal hunting community, this is a masterwork of a Hush-Hush medal which sets a great example for what medals set out to be.

If you wish to entertain yourself with fun unique challenges that give you shiny medallions that show on your profile, please, by all means, consider becoming a medal hunter. Furthermore, if you do not know the solution to a medal such as this one, consider following the footsteps medal hunters must take for every new Hush-Hush medal that comes out. Ephemeral and the osu!team go out of their way to make medals the community goes crazy over. So much so, that there is a chance that the next medal batches may have medals specifically made for osu!(lazer)!

Does being a medal hunter seem like something that could spark your interest? Do you believe you can crack medals as creatively sophisticated as this one? If so, don't hesitate to give it a shot!

As a final note, we are truly grateful to every medal hunter for your contributions to solving Internment during the past month, we wouldn't have achieved it without you! Thanks and see you next time!
