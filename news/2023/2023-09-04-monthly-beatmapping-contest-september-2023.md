Let's be honest: the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) isn't anything special — but that may be what makes it so valuable.

This is a plain 'n' simple mapping contest, allowing mappers to show off their talents! (...and earn some [prizes](#prizes) along the way.)

Let's break it down:

## Game modes

This month's contest is open to **osu!** and **osu!XXXXX** mappers.

- [osu!xxxx contest listing](LINK)

Next month's contest will feature **osu!YYYY** and **osu!ZZZZ**.

## Timeline

- [**Beatmapping (3 weeks):**](#beatmapping) Contest is announced and beatmappers create their entries.
- [**Screening (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) Entries are evaluated by experienced beatmappers. If there aren't many entries, this will be skipped in favour of a longer judging period.
- [**Judging (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) Top entries from screening are judged in detail by a different crew of experienced beatmappers.
- [**Rewards (~2 months from now):**](#rewards) Winners are announced at the start of another MBC.

## Beatmapping

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest!

Feel free to cut longer songs to a more reasonable length if needed. Talk to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) if you need help with that!

### Limitation

Creating a quality beatmap is a solid goal, but true creativity comes when your tools are restricted.

That's why we're adding **limitations** to this contest!

A limitation is simply an extra rule your map needs to follow. If we didn't have this, anyone could just submit an already-completed map to the contest, and that'd be pretty boring.

#### osu! limitation

This month's osu! limitation: **all sliders must be curved.**

More specifically, *every segment of a slider must be curved.* Here's some visual examples to clear things up:

Part of the judging criteria involves how you handle the limitation, so keep that in mind if you're creating [sliders that are *technically curved* yet look exactly like straight sliders](/wiki/shared/news/2023-09-04-monthly-beatmapping-contest-september-2023/technicality.png).

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Judging winner:** 2 points
- **Judging runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may vary depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
