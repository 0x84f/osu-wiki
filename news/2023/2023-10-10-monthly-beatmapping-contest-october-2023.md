For those out of the loop, the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) is exactly what you'd expect: a mapping contest that runs each month... for different game modes.

This month's contest is open to **osu!taiko** and **osu!catch** mappers.

Next month's contest will feature a new contest for **osu!** and **osu!mania**, along with the results for [September's contests](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-09-09-monthly-beatmapping-contest-september-2023)!

## Timeline

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest! Feel free to cut songs as needed.

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may vary depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

If you're looking for a lawless contest, wait for the next [Aspire](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Contests/Aspire). In the meantime, pay attention:

- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).**
- **Your submission must be solely made by you.** Collaborations are not allowed for this contest!

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias. During this process, storyboards and backgrounds may be removed, and for osu!taiko, elements that don't affect gameplay (such as object locations in the editor) will be standardised across all submissions.
