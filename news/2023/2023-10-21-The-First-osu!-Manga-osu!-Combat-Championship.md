WhiteCat, kinda aloof, fairly tense yet intelligent and careful in his words, he is also determined and focused, he lost his brother BlackDog at a young age due to an incident while BlackDog was working for mrekk. Whitecat has always blamed mrekk for his loss but is conflicted if to get revenge or to prove himself to be the best osu! player of all time in a fair manour. Whitecat at the age of 15 was restricted due to releasing a power he had no control over and went crazy the only one who could stop him was peppy.

mrekk is a business man through and through, will go to any lengths to make a profit and succeed, rarely has time or the desire to persue frivolous things such as relationships or family, gets stronger solely to benefit his business, desire to make a profit is born out of an aversion to poverty due to a deep seated trauma he had as a child.

Umbre, On the surface he’s a bit of a jokester cracking light-hearted quips at whitecat and generally being a swell guy to be around. He is a very effective mentor as whitecat’s brother-figure after blackdog died, helped raise him to the state he is today, but suffers from an inferiority complex at seeing whitecat get much stronger much faster than he can (umbre the player vs umbre the brother) however his kind demeanor prevails and he decides to be the one to get whitecat to heights he himself could never see.
