Welcome to **The Followpoint**, a brand new series of interview-style newsposts (and podcasts), with a different guest each release! This time around we were joined by [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335), the swole seagull who is in charge of all the magic behind medals!

Ephemeral, joining the game in August 2009, has taken an active part in the development of osu!, hitting a large amount of milestones in the game. He has made one of the game's most popular beatmaps, acted as a key role in the development of the Mapping Assistance Team (MAT), and even developed many key features in the game that are still used today! Presently, he has the role of Community Manager and leads medal development. A few medal hunters decided to organize an interview, which anyone could attend to ask any and all questions their souls had, as well as learn more about this well-accomplished community member.

On October 28th, the [osu! Medal Hunters](https://discord.gg/8qpNTs6) Discord server staff hosted an interview with Ephemeral, and in this newspost you'll be able to watch the recording of the full event below: 

(**This video reveals solutions to multiple medals. If you want to search for their solutions yourself, you may want to hold off on watching the video for now.**)
