## Previous contest results

### osu! results

**61** submissions were reviewed by our [screening crew](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening), **15** of which were evaluated by a separate [judging panel](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging)!

[See the full results here.](LINK)

| User | Beatmap | Placement | Badge prize | [Contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| [Lasse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/896613) | link | Screener's pick | - | +1 (1 total) |

To start, [acnozei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10141268) and [Lasse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/896613) completely dominated the screening phase! Each of their maps were praised equally, yet they were far ahead of the next map in line, earning both a single [contest point](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) towards the *Elite Mapper* title.

<!-- paragraph below is pending finalized judging. this flows best so i hope acnozei wins lol -->

[acnozei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10141268)'s talent only continued to impress, earning them the top spot in the judging panel and 3 more contest points! [user](LINK) and [user2](LINK) were close behind, earning 2 and 1 contest points respectively.

### osu!mania results

**50** piano mashers gave their keyboards a break and explored the editor this month. **10** of them were awesome enough to pass the [screening phase](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening), and a separate [judging panel](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) thoroughly investigated the entries to determine who wears the crown.

After submitting maps to the Monthly Beatmapping Contest **10 times** throughout 2020 and 2021, [Lott](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13821222) casually dropped into the first iteration of 2023's MBC with a landslide winning. It's about time, so congrats!

[hemoo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4420703)'s runner-up submission is impressive in its own right too! The screening crew almost universally praised their entry, boosting hemoo's [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) total to match Lott's.

Ooooooooookay. That's enough about the past — let's talk about this month's contest!

## Beatmapping

### Limitation/theme

Each MBC includes a different way to keep mappers on their toes. This limitation/theme is one of the judging categories, so try to implement it in an interesting way!

If you're confused about how these work, feel free to ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) (for osu!) or [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=7080063) (for osu!mania).

#### osu!

This month's osu! limitation focuses on rhythm: **there must be a 1 beat (or longer) gap within every 2 bars of music.**

For example, there are 2 bars of music between these circles:

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-11-09-monthly-beatmapping-contest-november-2023/2measures.png)

So this would be an acceptable rhythm:

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-11-09-monthly-beatmapping-contest-november-2023/gap.png)

And this wouldn't:

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-11-09-monthly-beatmapping-contest-november-2023/nogap.png)

#### osu!mania

If you're proficient in LN and normal note layering, this month's contest is for you.

[RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063) aims for perfection. That's why the osu!mania theme this month follows the [golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio): **the ratio of *normal notes* to *long notes* (or vice versa) should be as close as possible to the golden ratio.**

This is best explained with an example. These numbers...

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-11-09-monthly-beatmapping-contest-november-2023/count.png)

...divide to either ~1.49 (1898/1270) or ~0.67 (1270/1898). The golden ratio is ~1.61, so to fit with the contest's theme, the map should be balanced to have more long notes or fewer normal notes.

The closer to the golden ratio your note counts are, the more points it'll earn in the *theme* judging category!

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may vary depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

If you're looking for a lawless contest, wait for the next [Aspire](/wiki/Contests/Aspire). In the meantime, pay attention:
