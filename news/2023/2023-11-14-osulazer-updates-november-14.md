### Changes

- **The "argon" skin has received a major overhaul.** The skin has been updated to a newer design, and it perfectly showcases the future of skinning with adjustable skinning elements.
- **Dynamic scaling for some skin elements.** This change makes some skin elements scale without squishing or stretching. Support for this is limited for now, but will be expanded in the future.
- **A new skin component has been added.** A new "player name" skin element has been added which automatically changes the name displayed based on whether you are playing a map yourself, or spectating someone.
- **Touchscreen detection has been added.** osu!(lazer) will automatically recognize if you are using a touch device, and apply the "touch device" mod. As soon as a non-touch input is detected, the mod is removed.
- **Columns in osu!mania are now expanded on mobile devices.** This is currently limited to the default "argon" skin, but it makes playing osu!mania on mobile devices easier.
- **New main menu sound effects.** Nothing much to be said here, except that they sound fantastic.
