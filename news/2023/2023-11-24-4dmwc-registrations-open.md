The 5th edition of the 4 Digit osu!mania World Cup opens up. Because key-smashing tournaments shouldn't be exclusive to the upper echelon of players!

With the [osu!mania World Cup 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K/) now behind us, it's time for the up-and-coming rising stars all across the globe to shine! We encourage registering on the most ambitious iteration of the tournament ever conceived. And just like the rosters change with each year, what are the changes we're expected to see on the tournament this time around?

## What's new

The pooling and mapping team have been working hard to bring the largest selection of custom maps the tournament has **ever** had! Moreover, the pool structure has deviated a bit from the norm. By not tightly categorizing maps, the aim is to foster a more competitive selection of charts while giving mappers more creative freedom over their works — a win-win situation!

Last but not least is the introduction of a **catch-up mechanic**. To summarize, if a team reached half the amount of points in any given match, the opponent *must* ban a map from the pool.
