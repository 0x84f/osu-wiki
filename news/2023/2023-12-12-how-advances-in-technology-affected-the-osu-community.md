Let's walk back through the past 15 years of osu!, and how various new technologies affected the game and the community.

![]()

Every now and then there's a new piece of tech that's slated to impact the gaming community at large, whether it'd be a new input device, a new way to squeeze more FPS out of your gaming systems, or a whole new way to experience games. While the osu! community has managed to stay unswayed as things such as virtual reality/augmented reality, cloud gaming & AI advancements due to them being inapplicable to osu!, there were still some things that changed the way the game is played, or at least changed the view of the most optimal way to play the game.

This post will cover the most well known examples of how new technology throughout the past 15 years impacted osu!, and what the results of widespread adoption are, or could have been.

## Graphics tablets as an input device (2007)

For those who might not be aware, osu! originally started out as an *Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan* clone for PC, which was a game that was exclusive to the Nintendo DS, a console that came, and could be used with the included stylus pen. So when peppy released osu!, it was only natural for players who already had a graphics tablet to try out osu! with it, and since the get-go it was considered a commodity input device that would more closely replicate the original Nintendo DS experience.

Tablets were pretty expensive compared to nowadays, and until cheaper alternatives to well known brands such as Wacom started showing up, the price was the biggest blocker that prevented the community from having tablets as a common, and in some ways their preferred input device. In 2013 osu! partnered with a relative newcomer in the graphics tablet industry, Huion, in order to sell an osu! version of the Huion H420 tablet, that was a cheap, but quality tablet to the community for the low, low price of $30.

Since then there has been a revision of the osu! tablet in 2016, but both versions of the tablets were not stocked since 2017, as [peppy wanted to focus on development of osu!(lazer)](https://twitter.com/ppy/status/846190076853870592), so efforts on restocking osu! merch were paused for the time being, and tablets haven't made a return into the osu!store since.

## Gaming mechanical keyboards enter the market (2010)

Mechanical keyboards have been a thing for decades, even in 2010, however after Razer put [gaming and mechanical switches into a compelling package](https://press.razer.com/product-news/the-worlds-first-mechanical-keyboard-designed-for-gaming-launched-at-gamescom-2010/), that launched the chain reaction that resulted in the mechanical keyboard market we know of today.

By 2010 osu! players were already shifting away from clicking circles with their mouse, to clicking with their Z and X keys, so it would make sense that as these new mechanical keyboards were getting more easy to adopt into their setups, players would start using them for osu! as well. And while there's nothing stopping anyone from playing osu with the membrane design keyboards, the community at large is suggesting to newer players to purchase a mechanical keyboard, as they believe it's a direct upgrade due to the better audio and touch feedback received when a button is pressed.

The mass adoption of mechanical keyboards did not only occur in the osu! community, but in the gaming community as a whole, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a gaming setup nowadays without one of these right in the middle.

## Mainstream adoption of high refresh rate LCD monitors (2012)

Around mid 2012 first LCD high refresh rate monitors were released with the rates as high as 144hz. Even before LCD monitors were a thing CRT's had the capability of refreshing up to 100hz in most cases (and even higher for high-end models), however with the introduction of the much lighter LCD monitors this technology slowly became much easier to adopt, and is now a staple of any modern gaming setup.

As osu! is a game with high amount of moving elements no matter the game mode, high refresh rate monitors quickly became the next most-sought-after commodity piece of gear, and the difference is definitely noticeable. While definitely being a visually noticeable upgrade in comparison to 60hz monitors, and some people swearing by high refresh rate monitors helping them read higher approach rates & scroll speeds, it did not stop players who could not afford them at the time from rising through the ranks and some of them even becoming top players regardless of the refresh rates of their monitor.

## Touch screen's rise and fall in mainstream popularity (2015-2017)

The earliest mentions of using touch screens as an input device came as soon as the game was released. Back then touch screens were not as prevalent, and most of, if not all touch screen devices were "Tablet PCs", which were laptops that had a keyboard that can be rotated, folded, or outright detached, along with a touchscreen. Even though these devices became available near the end of 2002, the price remained high even in 2007, which again served as a blocker for mass-spread adoption. However, in years to come touch screens have got cheaper to implement across a range of devices, but it was still a niche play style that would never see any real use.... until two players proved them wrong.

### Kuvster (2015)

In 2015, [Kuvster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4896624) had a unique opportunity â€” snag the pp record under a very specific set of circumstances, and with touch screen as well. Back in the day "TAG4" maps were [approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved), hence you were able to get pp on them. They weren't playable for a regular player, but if you had a touch screen and were apt with it, you were eligible to grab the pp record, which is what he did:

    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DPTomHS6l4k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The 577pp record was short-lived though, as after this all TAG4 maps were exempt from giving pp, and in 2019 TAG4 maps were moved to the [Loved category](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved). This however is not the event what "killed" touchscreen, that would be done 2 years later.

### Freedomdiver (2017)

[Freedomdiver](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8482062) joined the osu! community in May 2016, and was your average player, up until the moment they realised they can play osu! with the touch screen on their laptop.

They played "[Future Son](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/357466#osu/786680)", a well known farm map of the time, and got a new top pp play almost immediately. The adrenaline rush, the pp frenzy started getting to them almost immediately. Using what they considered the "path of least resistance", they quickly surged through the ranks and soon enough, they had a 700pp play, which was very high in 2016. The community turned against them and cries were made for touch screen nerfs, but it wouldn't be until November 2017 when freedomdiver decided to push touch screen to its limits, in an effort to showcase how ridiculously overpowered touch screens were.

On November 15th 2017, freedomdiver broke the pp record 3 times, all on the infamous "[haitai](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/459149#osu/994495)" map. These scores were not made just for fun, freedomdiver had a point to prove. They agreed with the community that touch screens were not fair, and they wanted to push their point so far that it could no longer be ignored. This is how the first 900pp play in osu! happened, but again it would not stand for long:

    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edogtxn6WSk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

A month later on December 15th, the touch screen nerf was pushed, along with a new touch screen detection method that would apply the "Touch Device" mod.

That meant that all touch screen plays going forward would automatically have the TD mod, which significantly reduced the amount of pp gained for jumps in any given map, effectively killing the play style from ever becoming relevant again. Some players like [goink](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1920049) still play with touch screen, but the golden ages of touch screen usage in osu! are now far behind us.

## "Rapid trigger" feature on analogue mechanical keyboards (2021)

"Rapid trigger" is a new keyboard software feature that's first been implemented by Wooting, a mechanical keyboard manufacturer. Due to its analogue nature made possible by the [hall effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect), it allows users to modify the position of any key's actuation point, or go beyond the need for a static actuation point altogether by using rapid trigger. Rapid trigger activates the key as soon as it's pressed down, and deactivates it as soon as its released, regardless of how far down the key was previously pressed. The GIF below visually represents how rapid trigger works.

This has caused quite a turmoil amongst the community, as some believe this greatly reduces the skill required to be considered "good at speed", and lowers the skill ceiling quite significantly by allowing players to be less precise with their technique, but still make inputs. The other side of the community argues that this is only beneficial for players who "mash" keys instead of trying to accurately hit notes. Even though 2 years later this is still an argued about topic, there are no real side effects that can be attributed to it. Players that were already considered good at speed in osu! have become even better, whether that is to contribute exclusively to the keyboard they are using, or the extra effort they have put into the game after getting excited to play with their new keyboards, remains up to the players themselves to determine.

There has been a niche of "mash" players that took advantage of rapid trigger and shortly grabbed the spotlight with flabbergasting high star rating passes, but that fire has long been extinguished, and the community moved on.

This is a fascinating way to look back through the ages and remind ourselves of a different, maybe a better time when things were simpler. When we did not have to worry about the best keyboards and tablets to use to become the best player instantaneously, and just enjoyed osu! for what it is, a rhythm game with an amazing community and one of the largest selections of beat maps in any rhythm game ever.

Or just maybe... I am an angry old man yelling at the clouds... I'll let you be the judge of that.
