Winter season has arrived, and so has the first 2024 osu! World Cup, but this time with a twist!

After witnessing the amazing close to the 2023 season with the osu! Wolrd Cup (for which we have an awesome recap that you can read [here](/news/2023/2023-12-10-osu-world-cup-2023-concludes.md) if you didn't already), it's time to kick off the 2024 tournament season, only this time, with a slight twist on the usual formula.

Seeing the amazing turnout for last year's 7K MWC, we have decided to expand the tournament format to have **24 teams** going out of the qualifier stage instead of the usual 16. This means that the tournament will have one extra week (which also makes it have the same duration as the other osu! World Cups), and that the top 8 teams from the bracket get one week off after the qualifiers in the form of a bye.

## How do I register?

**[Click here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/42)**

Please note that teams will be formed by each country's captain *after* the registration phase has concluded. **The deadline for registering is December 28, 23:59 UTC. Make sure to submit yours before then!**

*Notice: you may only participate if your position in the osu!mania 7K global ranking is #5,000 or higher, and you have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months.*

If your registration passes our internal checks, you will be placed on the candidate list for your country. When that country's captain has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.
