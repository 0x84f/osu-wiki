It's been a while since the last issue of this series of posts! So much so it had its name slightly modified. For those unfamiliar with the [Quality Assurance Team Blog](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team/Quality_Assurance_Team_Blog) and its ensuing [QAT Gazette](/news/2017-09-07-qat-gazette-september-2017), this was one of the main ways updates to the Ranked section and its systems were announced by the hands of the [Quality Assurance Team](wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team).

Fast-forward five years later, the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) has decided to reinstate the Gazette with similar goals in mind — to connect with the community and issue updates on a periodic basis!

Without further ado, let's get to the nitty-gritty of this month's series of updates, shall we?

## Updates

In order to better organize ourselves and give some time to adapt, the NAT has opted to deploy updates in batches. Once enough meaningful changes have been discussed, these will be officially updated in one fell swoop. The Gazette will try to follow this sporadic update schedule likewise.

### Within the Ranked section

**Blocking Qualified maps with pending posts:** Beatmaps with open suggestions or problems in the discussion board will **not** be able to be Ranked, and the timer will not stop until the posts are either closed or the map gets disqualified to address the points made

**Join the RC cleanup project:** There's currently a community-driven [Ranking Criteria cleanup project](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1836226?n=1) in the works. If you believe you can contribute something to it, we encourage to give it a shot to help the team out!

**Ranking Criteria changes**

- **General:** Changes on how the `Featured Artist` tag should be used, and a special mention on how to credit AI generated media in the beatmap's description.
- **osu!:** Clarification on how to use hitsounds on actively clicked parts of objects.
- **osu!taiko:** Relaxed the rest time requirements for Kantan and Futsuu difficulties.
- **osu!catch:** Changed the CS and HP guidelines for Rain and Overdose difficulties respectively, and an extra guideline on how to use higher-snapped hyperdashes was added.
- **osu!mania:** Key modes over 10 keys are now rankable so long they follow an allowed [playstyle](/wiki/Beatmapping/osu%21mania_10K_plus_playstyles).

### Within the Beatmap Nominators
- Activity changes
- Join changes (Rejoin + 150 kudos requirement + Cooldowns)
- BN Request website feature (?)

### Within the Nomination Assessment Team
- Eval changes (Activity + no 6 month)
- SEV changes (Think it fits here more than the BN part as BNs don't have to deal with it any longer)

## Milestones
Milestones reached by BNs/NAT members in the past 3-6 months.
- Tenure badges
- Nomination milestones
- BN additions and promotions to Full BN (?)
- Promotions to the NAT (?)

## Stats
Fancy stats from the past 3 months. Potentially with graphs?
- Total noms/DQs per mode
