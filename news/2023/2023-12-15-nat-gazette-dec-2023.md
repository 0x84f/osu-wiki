It's been a while since the last issue of this series of posts! So much so it had its name slightly modified. For those unfamiliar with the [Quality Assurance Team Blog](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team/Quality_Assurance_Team_Blog) and its ensuing [QAT Gazette](/news/2017-09-07-qat-gazette-september-2017), this was one of the main ways updates to the Ranked section and its systems were announced by the hands of the [Quality Assurance Team](wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team).

Fast-forward five years later, the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) has decided to reinstate the Gazette with similar goals in mind — to connect with the community and issue updates on a periodic basis!

Without further ado, let's get to the nitty-gritty of this month's series of updates, shall we?

## Updates

In order to better organize ourselves and give users some time to adapt, the NAT has opted to deploy updates in batches. Once enough changes have been discussed and approved, these will be merged in one fell swoop. The Gazette will try to keep up with this sporadic update schedule.

### Within the Ranked section

#### Blocking Qualified maps with pending posts

Beatmaps with open suggestions or problems in the discussion board will **not** be able to be Ranked, and the timer will not stop until the posts are either closed or the map gets disqualified to address the points made.

#### Join the RC cleanup project

There's currently a community-driven [Ranking Criteria cleanup project](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1836226?n=1) in the works. If you believe you can contribute something to it, we encourage to give it a shot to help the team out!

#### Ranking Criteria changes

- **General:** Changes on how the `Featured Artist` tag should be used, and a special mention on how to credit AI generated media in the beatmap's description.
- **osu!:** Clarification on how to use hitsounds on actively clicked parts of objects.
- **osu!taiko:** Relaxed the rest time requirements for Kantan and Futsuu difficulties.
- **osu!catch:** Changed the CS and HP guidelines for Rain and Overdose difficulties respectively, and an extra guideline on how to use higher-snapped hyperdashes was added.
- **osu!mania:** Key modes over 10 keys are now rankable so long they follow an allowed [playstyle](/wiki/Beatmapping/osu%21mania_10K_plus_playstyles).

### Within the Beatmap Nominators

#### BN activity changes

Beatmap Nominators rejoining in good terms are now expected to nominate their mode's [minimum activity requirements](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators/Rules#requirements) in the first 30 days since their rejoin. Make sure to be able to reach it when asking to join back into the team!

#### Joining & rejoining

All modes will now require 150 kudosu to be able to apply, bringing osu!'s requirement in line with the other modes. Moreover, Beatmap Nominators leaving in good terms can rejoin the team instantly **up to one year** after their departure! Members who got kicked for their low activity however, will now be able to submit a new application right after their departure.

Finally, cooldowns for failed applications have been reduced all across the board! The standard length will be 60 days, with reduced cooldowns being only 30 days now. Failing an application will not be as punishing as it used to be, so don't be afraid to [apply to the team today](https://bn.mappersguild.com/bnapps)!

#### Brand new website features

Beatmap Nominators can now set their map and song preferences in the [BN website](https://bn.mappersguild.com/home) in a much more detailed way. This will make it easier for users to know who to request a map from by parsing through the list of open members and their respective preferences. 

### Within the Nomination Assessment Team

#### Evaluation changes

Activity evaluations will (mostly) be automated. The consensus and feedback will be set automatically, but these will still need an Evaluator to check them before they can be sent. Additionally, Evaluators are no longer able to extend a Beatmap Nominator's evaluation cycle past 3 months.

#### The Impact of our actions

To put it shortly, SEV values are no more — yippe! Beatmap Nominators will not have to worry about these numbers any longer. Instead, the system has been changed to aid Evaluators when assessing the significance of a disqualification or nomination reset.

These will be measured by their **Impact**. A DQ can either be *Minor* or *Notable* depending on the severity of the issue. As a rule of thumb, anything that used to be 1/1 or above should be considered *Notable*, whereas anything below should be considered *Minor*.

This change should help BNs not to stress too much over arbitrary numbers, and help Evaluators assess DQs by their importance and not just by the accumulation of severity alone.

## Milestones

### Badges

Users who got a tenure or nomination badge

### Additions & promotions

New additions to the BN team and recent promotions

### Nomination stats

Total noms/DQs per mode

We hope this has been informative! We'd like to know your opinion on both the changes and the Gazette as a means to connect with the community. Furthermore, we'll be more than happy to answer any and all questions you may have. The more we can interact with the community, the better!

Until next time. We hope you've enjoyed today's "patch notes".
