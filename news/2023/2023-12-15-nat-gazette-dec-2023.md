It's been a while since the last issue of this series of posts! So much so it had its name slightly modified. For those unfamiliar with the [Quality Assurance Team Blog](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team/Quality_Assurance_Team_Blog) and its ensuing [QAT Gazette](/news/2017-09-07-qat-gazette-september-2017), this was one of the main ways updates to the Ranked section and its systems were announced by the hands of the [Quality Assurance Team](wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team).

Fast-forward five years later, the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) has decided to reinstate the Gazette with similar goals in mind — to connect with the community and issue updates on a periodic basis!

Without further ado, let's get to the nitty-gritty of this month's series of updates, shall we?

## Updates

In order to better organize ourselves and give users some time to adapt, the NAT has opted to deploy updates in batches. Once enough changes have been discussed and approved, these will be merged in one fell swoop. The Gazette will try to keep up with this sporadic update schedule.

### Within the Ranked section

#### Blocking Qualified maps with pending posts: 

Beatmaps with open suggestions or problems in the discussion board will **not** be able to be Ranked, and the timer will not stop until the posts are either closed or the map gets disqualified to address the points made

#### Join the RC cleanup project:

There's currently a community-driven [Ranking Criteria cleanup project](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1836226?n=1) in the works. If you believe you can contribute something to it, we encourage to give it a shot to help the team out!

#### Ranking Criteria changes:

- **General:** Changes on how the `Featured Artist` tag should be used, and a special mention on how to credit AI generated media in the beatmap's description.
- **osu!:** Clarification on how to use hitsounds on actively clicked parts of objects.
- **osu!taiko:** Relaxed the rest time requirements for Kantan and Futsuu difficulties.
- **osu!catch:** Changed the CS and HP guidelines for Rain and Overdose difficulties respectively, and an extra guideline on how to use higher-snapped hyperdashes was added.
- **osu!mania:** Key modes over 10 keys are now rankable so long they follow an allowed [playstyle](/wiki/Beatmapping/osu%21mania_10K_plus_playstyles).

We hope this has been informative! We'd like to know your opinion on both the changes and the Gazette as a means to connect with the community. Furthermore, we'll be more than happy to answer any and all questions you may have. The more we can interact with the community, the better!

Until next time. We hope you've enjoyed today's "patch notes".
