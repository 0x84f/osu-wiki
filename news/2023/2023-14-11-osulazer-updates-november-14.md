### Changes

- **The argon skin has received a major overhaul.** The skin has been updated to a newer design, and it perfectly showcases the future of skinning with adjustable skinning elements.
- **Adjusting skin elements will now be done via their size, and not scale.** This change makes it easier to edit a skin without squishing or stretching the element out. Support for this is limited for now, but will be expanded in the future.
- **Touchscreen detection has been added.** osu!(lazer) will automatically recognize if you are using a touch device, and apply the "touch device" mod automatically. As soon as a non-touch input is detected, the mod is removed.
- **Columns in osu!mania are now expanded on mobile devices.** This is currently limited to the default "argon" skin, but it makes playing osu!mania on mobile devices easier.
- **New main menu sound effects.** Nothing much to be said here, except that they sound fantastic.
- **Quick retrying is now implemented.** Now you can spam retry 14 times before actually playing the map, just the way the circle clicking Gods intended.
