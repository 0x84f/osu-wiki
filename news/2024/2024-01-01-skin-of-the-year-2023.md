Skin of the Year is back for its 2nd iteration, and once again it's time to look back and pick out the best skins from the previous year!

With the new year barely getting started, now is the perfect chance to look back at 2023 and choose the highlights of the year, regardless of the topic. Looking back at skinning in 2023, there was only [1 official skinning contest](/wiki/Contests/Skinning_Contest/4), however that did not demotivate the skinning community in continuing to create high quality content for the entire community.

Furthermore, [an osu!(stable) update](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog/stable40/20231021.2) in late October added skinning support for some song select components, which are now being implemented in both new and older skins released during the year. So without further ado, let's quickly go over the details.

## Voting details

All skins that have been released during 2023 and have been added to [the compendium](https://compendium.skinship.xyz/) are eligible to compete, **including contest & podium entries**. Everyone gets **15** votes each to cast, and you can spend as many or as few as you like.

The top-voted entry will receive a unique profile badge based on their entry and 3 months of osu!supporter for their victory, while the remaining finalists will receive 1 month of osu!supporter each.

This year we had **TBD** skins that have been submitted to the [skinning forums](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/15), **TBD** of them being added to the compendium. We highly suggest you get to some light browsing and check out the submitted skins, and you might find a new skin you will be able to call your "main".

[**Click here to get involved and vote for 2023's Skin of the Year!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/170)

The voting will remain open for **TBD** after this post goes up, closing officially on the **TBD**. Hopefully, that should be enough time to go through the catalogue and pick your favourites.

Thanks to everyone who submitted their hard work to the compendium, and good luck!
