Calling all 5 Digits! After a long wait, 5WC is back with higher stakes than ever before!

![](/wiki/Tournaments/5WC/2024/img/5wc2024-banner.png)

The 5 Digit World Cup is the annual grand event for players ranked #10,000-99,999 in osu! and features some of the strongest competition osu!'s intermediate tournament scene has to offer. Last year, we received a staggering 2,740 registrations from 69 different countries. Against all odds, Team France (#4) managed to narrowly squeeze out a miracle: **Two** back to back grand finals tiebreaker victories against Team Russia (#2) in a monumental >4 hour match. This came after having defeated an incredibly strong Team Netherlands (#1) in the prior losers bracket grand final. This year, we can't wait to feature both old and new players from around the world and watch them battle it out for the grand prize - the illustrious 5WC 2024 badge, among other rewards!

## Changes From 2023

[5WC 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1699537?n=1) featured lots of improvements from previous iterations, but every rose has its thorns. This year we took a moment to reflect on how to further reduce points of discomfort/awkwardness that still exist in the series. For starters, last year's freemod rules proved to be too confusing for our liking. Additionally, we found the notoriously-harsh BWS to be too restrictive. Feedback also noted that our qualifier procedure felt awkward, so we revamped the qualifiers stage to be more comfortable and thorough.

### Key Changes

- 5WC 2024 now uses the standard [BWS](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/Badge-weighted_seeding) formula and does not count tournament badges earned before Jan 1, 2021.
- The qualifiers procedure has changed: We now feature a pool with 14 maps at a harder difficulty target than before (6.5 stars).
- The qualifiers mappool will not feature a freemod map.
- This year's grand finals mappool is slightly more challenging at 7.0 stars.
- There is an all-new web-based registrations process!

## Registrations

Players and organizers will need to login **[here](https://5wc.stagec.xyz/)** to register and/or manage their teams. Organizers have a new, private web interface they can use to manage their teams. Players who are selected will not know until told directly by their organizer.

Additionally, prospective players must:
- Not be restricted or hold an active tournament ban by the end of registrations
- Must not violate the 5WC 2024 community rules in a way which warrants disqualification.
- Be within the rank range of #10,000-99,999 after the [BWS formula](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/Badge-weighted_seeding) is applied with badges earned on or after 01-01-2021.
