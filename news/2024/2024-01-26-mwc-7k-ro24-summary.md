### Match highlights

We may just be getting started, but we already had a few matches that are worth highlighting take place.

### ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil vs. ::{ flag=PT }:: Portugal

[**View the VOD here!**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2038389122)

Brazil vs. Portugal was a match that went as one would have expected on paper, but there is one thing during this match that we would like to highlight.

Almost every single 7K tournament player in the recent years have that one annoying skill set to deal with. Usually, early-stage LN Coordination charts (The "Oh boy, 2* in the pool!" trap) faces the fate of being the most banned chart in a mappool. In this match, however, the stars aligned in such a way that LN Coordination was left as an open option.

Portugal was down 4-0 coming into their third pick of the match, with only a limited amount of options left to turn the match around. ::{ flag=PT }:: [Rodrig0v](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/138866), their team captain, made the decision to exhaust the LN pool and selected the notorious LN1 chart, [Mitsukiyo - Theme_37](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119592#mania/4452483). Clocking in at 69 BPM, and with only 313 long notes, absolutely no one can afford any misses. The chart started and everyone's combos and accuracies started dropping like flies except for one person holding on (literally!). It was Rodrig0v who is doing more than enough to give Portugal that sweet, sweet advantage. While Brazil will eventually have an S-rank score coming from ::{ flag= BR }:: [LothusFangirl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4685756), it wasn't enough to cover for the heroics made by Portugal's captain.

The match eventually ended in Brazil's favour 5-1, but this moment will always be in our hearts.

### ::{ flag=NL }:: Netherlands vs. ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan

### ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation vs. ::{ flag=DK }:: Denmark

[**View the VOD here!**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2039423606)

Russia went into this match as a favourite to win on paper, given their roster and their qualifier performance, and Denmark carries some very respectable players like ::{ flag=DK }:: [Fritte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5001658) and ::{ flag=DK }:: [Jole](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2883132), with other players that can keep up.

While the seeding implies that this will be a very one-sided match, it was anything but. Both teams won their first picks, and the next two picks were a trade of break points. Russia had some unfortunate mishaps on [litmus\* - Flashdance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119632#mania/4452673), while Denmark gave away LN2 pick — [DJ Totoriott - Chronoxia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119552#mania/4452390) — with ::{ flag=RU }:: [Meiju's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5527957) score making all the difference between tying up the score versus letting Denmark get away with a lead.

Russia had an obvious getaway pick with [shadow\_bling - Crush Alcohol](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2062870#mania/4452380) — but misses from both sides kept this close until the Russians barely pulled away in the end of the chart. Denmark went for [seatrus - Raindrop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119535#mania/4452365) as a counter, with Jole coming into this chart as one of the formidable chordstream players in this round. They definitely showed up with a 5x 200 score on Raindrop tying up the scoreline yet again.

Both teams were put in a very difficult position given the remaining charts in the pool, ending up in a tiebreaker scenario on [Massive New Krew - Majestic 12](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119554#mania/4452392), that resulted in the Russians winning the match 5—4.
