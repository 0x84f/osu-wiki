### Match highlights

We may just be getting started, but we already had a few matches that are worth highlighting take place.

### ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil vs. ::{ flag=PT }:: Portugal

[**View the VOD here!**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2038389122)

Brazil vs. Portugal was a match that went as one would have expected on paper, but there is one thing during this match that we would like to highlight.

Almost every single 7K tournament player in the recent years have that one annoying skill set to deal with. Usually, early-stage LN Coordination charts (The "Oh boy, 2* in the pool!" trap) faces the fate of being the most banned chart in a mappool. In this match, however, the stars aligned in such a way that LN Coordination was left as an open option.

Portugal was down 4-0 coming into their third pick of the match, with only a limited amount of options left to turn the match around. ::{ flag=PT }:: [Rodrig0v](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/138866), their team captain, made the decision to exhaust the LN pool and selected the notorious LN1 chart, [Mitsukiyo - Theme_37](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119592#mania/4452483). Clocking in at 69 BPM, and with only 313 long notes, absolutely no one can afford any misses. The chart started and everyone's combos and accuracies started dropping like flies except for one person holding on (literally!). It was Rodrig0v who is doing more than enough to give Portugal that sweet, sweet advantage. While Brazil will eventually have an S-rank score coming from ::{ flag= BR }:: [LothusFangirl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4685756), it wasn't enough to cover for the heroics made by Portugal's captain.

The match eventually ended in Brazil's favour 5-1, but this moment will always be in our hearts.

### ::{ flag=NL }:: Netherlands vs. ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan

### ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation vs. ::{ flag=DK }:: Denmark

[**View the VOD here!**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2039423606)

Russia and Denmark looked to be a one-sided match, but it was far from it.

Russia opened the proceedings with a very straightforward run on [MYUKKE. - Unknown Amnasia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119541#mania/4452375) (RC5) drawing first blood. The Danes, immediately replied with a very close win on [Camellia - PURE SILVER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1371480#mania/2835613) (HB2). Action became a bit more tense when both teams managed to trade break points. Russia's unfortunate mishaps on [litmus* - Flashdance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119632#mania/4452673) (RC3) became Denmark's gain.

Unfortunately for them, they lost the advantage when Russia tied the match up 2-2 through the help of ::{ flag=RU }:: [Meiju](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5527957)'s clean FC on [DJ Totoriott - Chronoxia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119552#mania/4452390) (LN2). ::{ flag=DK }:: [Jole](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2883132) replied with the third best score on RC2 [seatrus - Raindrop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119535#mania/4452365) (RC2) to help the Danes tie up the match yet again. A late LN break from ::{ flag=DK }:: [-Melon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7266339) on [Ym1024 - Cosmoscape](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119553#mania/4452391) (HB1) put Russia to match point. They did manage to redeem themselves on [MANY THANKS! feat. Setsu minami - Banka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119604#mania/4452563) (RC4) to force the tiebreaker. Not to mention, ::{ flag=DK }:: [Fritte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5001658)'s run it turned out to be the best of all RC4 scores over the weekend.

The Danes had the chance to pull off the biggest upset of the weekend through the tiebreaker, but in the end, the Russians flexed their muscles and ended the match 5-4.
