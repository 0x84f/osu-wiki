The osu!mania 7K World Cup is officially underway! Continuing on from the osu! World Cup recaps, you can once more expect a summary of the latest and greatest of MWC, made possible by community members just like you! This year, **for the first time ever**, the tournament kicked off with a Round of 24! Due to increased interest from various countries that have both applied and qualified, we have been blessed with an extra round and exciting matches straight away!

Before getting into the highlight matches, let's quickly reflect (or familiarise) ourselves with the Round of 24 mappool.

Stay tuned for all [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) that are up to come — you may see them Ranked earlier than you think so!

### Match highlights

We may just be getting started, but we already had a few matches that are worth highlighting take place.

### ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil vs. ::{ flag=PT }:: Portugal

[**View the VOD here!**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2038389122)

Brazil vs. Portugal was a match that went as one would have expected on paper, but there is one thing during this match that we would like to highlight.

Almost every single 7K tournament player in the recent years have that one annoying skill set to deal with. Usually, early-stage LN Coordination charts (The "Oh boy, 2* in the pool!" trap) faces the fate of being the most banned chart in a mappool. In this match, however, the stars aligned in such a way that LN Coordination was left as an open option.

Portugal was down 4—0 coming into their third pick of the match, with only a limited amount of options left to turn the match around. ::{ flag=PT }:: [Rodrig0v](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/138866), their team captain, made the decision to exhaust the LN pool and selected the notorious LN1 chart, [Mitsukiyo - Theme_37](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119592#mania/4452483). Clocking in at 69 BPM, and with only 313 long notes, absolutely no one can afford any misses. The chart started and everyone's combos and accuracies started dropping like flies except for one person holding on (literally!). It was Rodrig0v who is doing more than enough to give Portugal that sweet, sweet advantage. While Brazil will eventually have an S-rank score coming from ::{ flag= BR }:: [LothusFangirl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4685756), it wasn't enough to cover for the heroics made by Portugal's captain.

The match eventually ended in Brazil's favour 5—1, but this moment will always be in our hearts.

### ::{ flag=NL }:: Netherlands vs. ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan

[**View the VOD here!**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2039351530)

The Netherlands vs. Taiwan match was one of the two closest matches we've seen this round! Suffice to say, with their seeds being #16 and #17 respectively, we knew we were in for a close match — but not this close!

Interestingly enough, this match was played without the team's protects. Despite that, neither one of the teams backed down and readjusted their strategies despite their comfort picks potentially being banned! The match ended up evolving into a constant back and forth, highlighted by ::{ flag = NL }:: [Tyronix](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11290311)'s overall performance and nerves of steel, ::{ flag = NL }:: [Freek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9630674)'s amazing LN scores, and Taiwan's extraordinary consistency all throughout the match!

But the final star of the show was the Tiebreaker, [Massive New Krew - Majestic 12](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119554#mania/4452392). While both teams were at their wit's ends, this didn't stop them from pushing themselves to the limit with quite a tight lead all things considered. Unfortunately for the Netherlands, Taiwan's consistency and control by the hands of ::{ flag=TW }:: [hero_jeff](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3375226) and ::{ flag = TW }:: [[EGEJ]Egg_Tart](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9666710) ended up giving them the edge.

Congratulations to both teams, as nobody could've predicted who would be taking the lead in such a close match!

### ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation vs. ::{ flag=DK }:: Denmark

[**View the VOD here!**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2039423606)

Russia went into this match as a favourite to win on paper, given their roster and their qualifier performance, and Denmark carries some very respectable players like ::{ flag=DK }:: [Fritte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5001658) and ::{ flag=DK }:: [Jole](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2883132), with other players that can keep up.

While the seeding implies that this will be a very one-sided match, it was anything but. Both teams won their first picks, and the next two picks were a trade of break points. Russia had some unfortunate mishaps on [litmus\* - Flashdance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119632#mania/4452673), while Denmark gave away LN2 pick, [DJ Totoriott - Chronoxia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119552#mania/4452390) — with ::{ flag=RU }:: [Meiju's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5527957) score making all the difference between tying up the score versus letting Denmark get away with a lead.

Russia had an obvious getaway pick with [shadow\_bling - Crush Alcohol](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2062870#mania/4452380) — but misses from both sides kept this close until the Russians barely pulled away in the end of the chart. Denmark went for [seatrus - Raindrop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119535#mania/4452365) as a counter, with Jole coming into this chart as one of the formidable chordstream players in this round. They definitely showed up with a 5x 200 score on Raindrop tying up the scoreline yet again.

Both teams were put in a very difficult position given the remaining charts in the pool, ending up in a tiebreaker scenario on [Massive New Krew - Majestic 12](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119554#mania/4452392), that resulted in the Russians winning the match 5—4.

### ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom vs. ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany

[**View the VOD here!**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2039449910)

The United Kingdom versus Germany match was a sight to behold! With similarly placed seeds, everyone expected everyone to fight tooth and nail in order to gain an advantage over their rivals.

From the very beginning, the teams didn't fear to show their preferred skill sets. While the United Kingdom banned a Long Note pick and picked a Rice one subsequently, Germany did the exact opposite. These biases were shown all throughout the match, as these teams stuck to their strong suits.

The match then began with [seatrus - Raindrop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119535#mania/4452365) where Germany managed to squeeze their first point thanks to their consistency despite the early miss. Little did they know this aforementioned consistency was going to be what would uplift their lead for the rest of the match! The advantage Germany gained thanks to their LN picks and ::{ flag = DE }:: [TsukiyaWhiskers](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12598261)' amazing performance throughout the match would unfortunately seal the deal as the United Kingdom was not able to maintain their leads.

Alas, this was no stomp by any stretch of the imagination. The United Kingdoms's performance was admirable. And while they weren't able to secure a point, they managed to put Germany on check more than a few times. And [Y.W - Freshness Vacation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119550#mania/4452388) was a testament to that.

Shout outs to ::{ flag = DE }:: [sinkip](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4373641) for playing the entire match [with a BMS controller](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2039250337?t=04h05m49s)!
