Japan is a rice team. With this year's incorporation of the BMS legend ::{ flag=JP }:: [butanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586) (current global #6 and someone that has been a BMS top player [since before osu!mania existed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRugloVbRV8)), him and ::{ flag=JP }:: [rainlily](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/485007) form a practically unbeatable duo in rice charts. In qualifiers, they were 1st overall in 2/4 rice-focused charts, and 2nd in the other two. They are capable of extraordinary accuracy up to an astounding physical level. However... this isn't BMS. This is mania. Here, there are Long Notes. And Poland *knew that*.

So, coming into the match, the strategy was clear. The eternal "rice vs. noodles" clash, which has happened and will surely happen again many times in this very tournament. The tone was set immediately with butanic's 997.8k SS on [Memory at Angels Landing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123235#mania/4461947), the chordstream pick. But Poland responded, with the veteran player ::{ flag=PL }:: [DaDarkDragon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8902097) leading the way to take the next point with [POODLE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123243#mania/4461965), the LN density pick.

And just after that, one of the most extraordinary exhibits of consistency we've seen so far, Japan's BMS duo getting a double 999k on the Jack pick [Wavetapper](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123274#mania/4462022), with the players getting 24 and 30 perfects respectively.

More blows were traded afterwards, with Poland picking up a second point on the Hard Hybrid [Fana](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123269#mania/4462015), before finally ending the match 5-2 in favour of Japan. Don't forget about Poland though, as they are sure to be a fierce competitor in the lower bracket.

### Individual score highlights

Let's try this out with bullet points, I just copied what noname wrote but needs to be cleaned up:

- Kura's very low scroll speed against Vietnam on HB1 last pick of the match
- butanic 996K on RC4
- Japanese team score vs. Korean team score on RC3 (53x300 vs 56x300?)
- dressurf upscoring butanic by literally 1x300 on RC3 (23 vs 24)
