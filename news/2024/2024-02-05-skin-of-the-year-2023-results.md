[Saow](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9782756)'s [- KEMOMINI EDM SQUAD -](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1791845) skin will be very familiar to skin connoisseur's as it was created for last year's [Icons of an Era](/wiki/Contests/Skinning_Contest/4) skinning contest, whose theme revolved around memorable beatmaps and osu! mascots from the last 15 years of osu!. Saow did a beautiful job of capturing the spirit of 2021's ranked map background [true DJ MAG top ranker's song Zenpen (katagiri Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1357624#osu/2809623), and netted themselves the 10th place with **714** votes.

Another "Icons of an Era" skinning contest entry grazes the top 10! [Ghost Rule](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1792933) by [Redo_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7122165) is a skin based on a couple of different beatmap sets of the song with the same name, all featuring similar art of Hatsune Miku. Featuring art by [xootynator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598), Redo\_ crafted yet another masterpiece, with which they managed to score **761** votes.

[星塵 DIVIDE ÷ 8](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1792739), another entry from "Icons of an Era", expands on the theme presented by the background on [Sotarks' set of quaver](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/873811#osu/1859185) by utilising a mix of very dark and bright colours. The beautiful tones of purple present throughout the background of most of the skin represent the darkness of the universe as we know it, with huge expanses of nothingness followed by beautiful, bright stars. For this stunning entry [thetasigma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6234482) earned themselves **767** votes.

[Touhou Project ~ Paper Touhou](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1746993) is a unique blend of the Touhou Project and the "paper" art-style that's been made popular by Nintendo ever since 2000. [CloudKeyz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15194624) used the original Paper Mario for the N64 as an inspiration and combined many of the more well known Touhou characters in order to craft a skin that has no right being as cute as it is, and for that community awarded them **782** votes.

Despite the fact they have only published 3 skins so far, [Chromasia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7306251) has only released highly polished, quality works of art. So it is no wonder that their entry for "Icons of an Era" has also been received **799** votes for this year's Skin of the Year contest. Focusing on art used behind [Seni's iteration of *Chronostasis*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1392153#osu/2874408) by FA [Release Hallucination](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/194), they capture the essence very well, and expand upon the theme set up by the background. Definitely be on the lookout for their future releases!

You really shouldn't be surprised that thetasigma is once again on this list, as they are a mainstay in the skinning community with many contest winning entries under their belt.
Their 2nd winning entry, [IT'S SHOWTIME! feat. Hatsune Miku](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1864406), was released at the very end of 2023, but still managed to get **827** votes, which really shows how much their skins are beloved by the community. The skin itself has several art-styles sprinkled throughout the skin, ranging from graffiti art to 8 bit skin elements, and of course features the lovely Hatsune Miku! Surely they won't have another entry on this list... right?

Yup, it's thetasigma again. They have truly reached the endgame for osu! skinning, with **3** different entries of theirs making it to the top 10! With **1026** votes, [GAME OVER](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1801331) has captivated the community with the 8bit-like aesthetic, along with just a perfect amount of anime girl on top. The skin prominently features [Silver Wolf](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Silver_Wolf), a character from the popular gacha game "[Honkai: Star Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honkai:_Star_Rail)". Unfortunately for thetasigma, they were unable to hack themselves into more entries on this list, so it's *game over* for them.

The winner of "Icons of an Era", [Spoo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11805037), claims their spot on this list with their stunning entry, [FOOL MOON NIGHT](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1775136). If you are somehow not familiar with the inspiration behind this skin, [*A FOOL MOON NIGHT*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/524026#osu/1141084) is an extremely popular 2016 beatmap set that inspired Spoo so much that they decided to draw **all** the skin elements present in the skin in the style of it's background! Such dedication has been noticed by the community and **1096** of them decided to award their votes to them, pushing them to the 3rd place.

An unexpected issue has occurred, causing this top 10 list to crash. Error code: N05T@LG1A_0V3RL0AD. [Miorine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12630408) harnessed the full power of the holy trinity — early 2000s nostalgia, an extremely popular Windows operating system, and creativity. With those three combined, [Windosu XP](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1790353) was crafted, and it caught the attention of the community right off the bat. Regardless of the fact that this is only the 2nd skin ever published by Miorine, they perfectly captured the nostalgia of many players which netted them a whopping **1511** votes, almost 400 more than 3rd place!

Everyone thought they were real funny commenting "rafis 2018-03-26 HDDT", or something along those lines. Well as it turns out, a skin with a similar amount of value, both historical and meme-wise, won this competition... Yup, [cyperdark](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9893708)'s [WhiteCat 3.0](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1864774) has been elected as **the** Skin of the Year, with **1574** votes! There isn't too much to say about the skin itself, it's centred around the top player [WhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101), it's clean, and it comes in a billion different variations to suit the needs of as many players as possible.
