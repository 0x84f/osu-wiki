China vs. Malaysia was a long-awaited clash between two 7K titans. These two teams have been consistent contenders for the MWC7K podium. China, the 2016 champions — came into this match having narrowly escaped with a tiebreaker win in the Quarterfinals. The Malaysian duo, on the other hand, will finally be tested against a team of their calibre.

These two countries are known as the 'noodle countries' due to their VSRG history. As such, this match was initially seen as a 'who will choke on their rice first' affair. As expected, Malaysia opened with LN3, [GHOST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2130609#mania/4480895), but it was China who drew first blood. The noodle-slurping action continued as China started with LN2, [Vulnerability](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2130611#mania/4480897), which happened to be their protected pick for this match. However, Malaysia were able to snatch this table away from them. Both teams then traded break points on the next two charts to level the match at 2–2.

The match continued with this tug of war until the LN and Hybrid picks ran out. At the end of LN4, [Revolt](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2130612#mania/4480900), China led 4–3, and it was their turn to pick. They chose RC6, [Kagaribi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2130665#mania/4481018), which did not work out well for them as Malaysia managed to level this match. The next two picks came from the rice side of the pool. RC4, [Voyage](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2130624#mania/4480927), once again ended in Malaysia's favour.

China's next selection had to go well for them to force a tiebreaker. They chose RC3, [tinnitus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2130608#mania/4480894), hoping to extend the match by one more map. In the end, it was Malaysia who closed out this match 4–6. ::{ flag=MY }:: [cheewee10](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4477497) lead the way with 10 MVP performances in 10 charts played, which is a particularly impressive showing in a match with two high-calibre teams.

Malaysia advanced to the Winner's Bracket Final where they will face perennial contenders South Korea for a place in the Grand Finals. China, on the other hand, will be in for an intense campaign in the Loser's Bracket.

### Japan ::{ flag=JP }:: vs. ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia
