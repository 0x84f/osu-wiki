There is something else besides love in the air... it's osu!(lazer) updates!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-19-osu-lazer-updates-february-19/banner.jpg)

This update unfortunately came a bit too late for Valentine's Day, but we are sure that you will *love* them!

### Smaller changes

- **Performance improvements, bug & visual fixes.** The team have continued their work on optimizing the game and improving the performance, let us know if you spot a difference!
- **New search filter and aliases have been added to song select.** You can now sort the song select carousel by last played maps, and the author and mapper names are also available as search options in song select.
- **2FA requests are now visible in the client.** Whether you are registering as a new user, or are a regular player, osu!(lazer) will now display that user input is required in order to proceed.
- **Select skin sprites are now converted to greyscale.** This fixes some elements displaying in colour when they are not supposed to, which can look weird.
- **Long text in dropdown menus is now truncated and display a tooltip with the full name.** If you have a skin collection that has a lot of entries with long names, you will appreciate this.
- **Deselecting sliders will no longer add control points.** Previously, if you were to select multiple objects including a slider, deselecting the slider would create a new control point instead of deselecting it.
- **Legacy Relax replays now work properly in lazer.** As stable does not record key presses in replays with Relax, watching them back in lazer made them look like Relax was not even enabled.

### More mods and mod settings grant PP

![]()

The community has asked for more mods and mod settings to be eligible for PP, and while variable DT rates are still not eligible, the additions are interesting.

### Display which mods grant pp

    <video width="95%" controls>
        <source src="" type="video/mp4" preload="none">
    </video>
</div>

With the release of ranked play for lazer, many players could not distinguish what mod combinations gave pp, and which didn't. With this change in both song select and mod select screens, the eligibility of the selected mod(s) is now clearly displayed.

### Online statistics changes are now visible in the toolbar

Changes to your pp and ranking stats are now visible in real-time on the toolbar. This was previously only visible in the detailed results screen, which is displayed when you click on your score in the results screen.

### Visual fixes in osu!catch

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <video width="95%" controls>
        <source src="" type="video/mp4" preload="none">
    </video>
</div>

There are two different changes to cover here, the first one being that the osu!catch playfield now only scales to an aspect ratio of 4:3. This is put in place to prevent people from playing on odd resolutions that would allow them to see more of the playfield than what is usually possible.

The 2nd change involves a small visual bug where the catcher plate (along with all the fruit) would flip once the direction of movement was changed. This behaviour has been removed in order to match stable.
