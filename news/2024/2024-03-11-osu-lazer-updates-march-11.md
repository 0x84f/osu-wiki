### Smaller changes

- **Fix mod select overlay settings order not always matching mod panels.** Mods like NC and DT will always remain in the same position in the mod customization menu, regardless of when they were selected.
- **Update F rank badge colours to match the latest designs.** You can now fail in a more fabulous fashion.
- **Fix main menu eating keys if user presses too fast.** Regardless of how fast you are at navigating menus, osu!(lazer) can now keep up.
- **Show user statistics updates on multiplayer and playlists results screens.** Previously upon map completion in multiplayer you were not able to see full play statistics such as pp gained etc.
- **Various stable parity tweaks.** Varying from visual to gameplay changes, the devs put in some extra work to make sure osu!(lazer) matches stable.
- **Various performance improvements.** Most of the performance updates this time around revolve about stutters users faced after last month's release switched to .NET 8, but there are also improvements when it comes to storyboard performance.
- **New main menu hotkeys.** Similar to stable, you will now be able to use hotkeys to quickly get to your desired destination. One example being `M M M` to quickly open the multiplayer menu.
- **The official osu! argon skin has now received its own pp counter.** Go check it out in-game!
