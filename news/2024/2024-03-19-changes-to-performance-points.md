Performance points and global rankings will be unstable for a short while. Read on to find out why!

As part of turning on performance points for osu!(lazer), there was a change in how much *bonus pp* would be awarded. In a [video by peppy and pishifat last month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7SZk8mU7Ww&t=40s), this change was mentioned to have been applied for the lazer client, and that it would be applied to stable at a later date. **Today is that day.**

Apart from the [weighted sum of your top performances](/wiki/Performance_points#weightage-system), your total pp value also includes a bonus portion depending on how much you've played. This bonus portion is 417 pp at its maximum and *used to be* achieved when you hit around 13,000 completed beatmap difficulties. That was changed to be around 1,500 difficulties.

Here's a graph if you're a visual person:

In short, you will find yourself having more bonus pp even if you haven't played 10,000+ maps.

Also, since both osu!(lazer) and osu!(stable) are now using the same performance point processor, your rank graph will no longer flip-flop when you switch between clients. This means if your graph looked something like this...

...it will resume its stable growth (or decay) once again.

Those were the details, but for the brass tax: **ranks will fluctuate until all users have been recalculated, performance calculations for score submissions may take a bit longer, and they may include discrepancies**.
