### Smaller changes

- epic changes

### Main menu banner rotation

The main menu sometimes shows a graphic for ongoing events. Support has been added to rotate between multiple of these, in case many events are happening simultaneously.

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <video width="95%" autoplay loop muted playsinline>
        <source src="https://wala.s-ul.eu/ocU72WOl.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="none">
    </video>
</div>

### Discord multiplayer invites

It's now possible to invite your friends on discord and have them join your multiplayer room with one click. See what that looks like in the video below:

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
