### Smaller changes

- **Add delayed resume after pausing has been added for osu!taiko, osu!catch & osu!mania.** This now means you have a couple of seconds to prepare yourself before the map resumes after a pause.
- **You can no longer fail in osu!catch during a banana shower.** The catch community can finally indulge in banana showers in peace.
- **Map/health disclaimers have been added.** Implementing even more stable features into osu!(lazer), if the map you are about to play contains scenes with flashing lights, is loved or qualified, a pop-up in the top left will show you the relevant disclaimer.
- **Misses are now displayed on the hit accuracy heatmap.** This means that you can finally confirm once and for all whether the top left side of the playfield really is impossible to hit.
- **The rotate tool button now works even if only 1 circle is selected.** A small, but welcome change for the mapping community.

### Main menu banner rotation

The main menu sometimes shows a graphic for ongoing events. Support has been added to rotate between multiple of these, in case many events are happening simultaneously.
