Since last year's 5 Digit World Cup (5WC), lots of 5 digit tournament players anticipated the return of this event. This year's iteration introduced some minor modifications to tournament procedures while focusing on refining the competitive experience to be the best 5WC possible. With four fantastic original songs and lots of original maps made by our mapping team (of which many remained from last year), this iteration features effort far and above anything seen before in the series.

Let's get going, since we have seven weeks of amazing matches, highlights and a few interviews to go over.

## Summary

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-04-28-5-digit-world-cup-2024-concludes/podium.jpg)

Congratulations to Poland for taking the first place this year. The other Grand Finalist, Canada, gave them a scare by winning the first match 7-5, bringing them to a bracket reset! But Poland prevailed and in the end, they won with 7-5, making them the deserving victors this year.

We want to thank and congratulate Canada and the United States for once again playing their hearts out this year and reaching the podium. For Canada, their second place finish is a return to the podium for the first time since 2019, with it also being their best result so far. For the United States, third place means their 6th consecutive top 8 finish and showing their consistency in forming great teams that get far into the bracket.

## Match highlights

The Round of 32, the first round of the tournament, normally a round without many close matches. But this year was different! We saw a bunch of close matches, but the match between Brazil and Hong Kong was the one that took the spot for most surprising match of the round.

Brazil, being the #10 seed from qualifiers, was the big favorite to move into the Round of 16. They were up against the #22 seeded Hong Kong, which should have posed no big troubles for the Brazilian team, but things turned out different.

After the start of the match, Brazil took a quick 2-0 lead, winning their protected HD2 and the FM1 pick from Hong Kong. Brazil picked NM4 as their next map, which in hindsight, was not the right pick. Hong Kong came back and took three straight map wins, including two breakpoints, taking the lead in the match with a 2-3 scoreline. After taking the lead, Hong Kong was the next team to pick. They picked HR1, which resulted in Brazil getting a second breakpoint, tying the match at 3-3. After the least two picks of the match, the score ended up in a 4-4 tie, forcing a tiebreaker.

In the end, Hong Kong took the win and won the match 4-5! Forcing Brazil into the losers bracket and moving on to the Round of 16 themselves.

### Round of 16: ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland vs. ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia

Ever since the great response from the 5WC 2023 Grand Finals tiebreaker custom song, it should be no surprise that this year had more than one original song.

To thank our amazing artists for their hard work and determination, we have listed all their songs below for you to listen to and play! Click on the banner of the respective song to go to the map that was made for the tournament.

## Interviews

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-04-28-5-digit-world-cup-2024-concludes/Birchman.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10676573)

> Hi I'm Birchman, I've been playing the game off and on since August 2017 and I've been playing tournaments semi-actively since August 2022. I was on Canada's 5wc roster last year and had the chance to play for Canada again this year as well.

Team Canada, which includes [Birchman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10676573), went on to place 2nd this year in the 5 Digit World Cup 2024, narrowly behind Poland.

---

Did you have any expectations going into the tournament? What went on in your minds as your team progressed into further stages?

> I remember last year, canada got top 6 in the tournament, and while I wouldn't say that I 100% expected a better placement from us this year, I was definitely hoping that we'd at least beat last year's top 6 placing.
> 
> I think as we got further and further into the tournament, we started analyzing the other teams more and some of our practice habits changed. I remember around the semifinals stage of the tournament, Fetherfall would look at the mappool early into the week and started to highlight the maps depending on how much we needed to practice them which really helped. I think the team overall took the tournament more seriously as we transitioned into the later stages.

How did you prepare for matches and 5WC itself?

> For matches, we'd run multiplayer lobbies every week to practice the mappool as a team. On top of that our coaches [FlatPaper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11255340) and [LumenLogic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8171404) made comparison spreadsheets so that we could see how our opponents did in previous rounds compared to us. To prepare for 5wc itself, I personally tried to learn how to play with HDHR since if you had a player taking HDHR on your team, another player could go NM, and with the Freemod rules not requiring a player on HD, I thought I'd be more useful if I learned HDHR for the team.

Are there any specific moments you remember the most vividly?

> There were a bunch of great moments in this tournament but I think my favorite moments happened in our match against the USA in losers bracket finals. After the match went to tie breaker, I remember how happy and relieved the team sounded after winning such a hard fought match, as well as all the nice messages we exchanged with the US roster after the fact. This whole match sort of stuck with me because of how close a lot of the members on Canada's and USA's roster's are to each other, and the sportsmanship shown in this match was just really heartwarming to see.

What was the first thing you did after the tournament?

> Honestly I was really sad after taking Poland all the way to bracket reset just to lose, and really didn't do too much other than thinking a lot about how the match could've ended with Canada winning. But on a more positive note, a day after the tournament concluded, LumenLogic made an announcement in the Canadian 5wc server highlighting our performance, as well as Canada B and C team's respective placements in the 5wc's Minor League (a separately hosted tournament). In the same announcement he also gave a shoutout to all the people who were involved with tryouts and roster making this year, which was a nice way to wrap up 5wc for Canada.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-04-28-5-digit-world-cup-2024-concludes/Naikou.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29139453)

> I'm a multigenre DTM producer that you probably don't know! I've been doing music for almost three years now and currently my style focuses on blending color bass elements with everything I do :3

[Naikou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29139453) is no stranger to composing for osu! tournaments, with works spanning [Coul's Scuffed Overskilled 5 Digit Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1739981?n=1), [osu!mania SQUID GAME](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1745098?n=1) and [4 Digit Player Tournament 6](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1871322?n=1). For the 5 Digit World Cup 2024, Naikou composed [Beyond Reality](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2163553) as the Finals tiebreaker track.

---

How did you start out, and what drives you to make music?

> I started out in mid 2021 making *Metroid* remixes! I didn't really start doing rhythm game music properly until mid 2022 but I got my first big push to get into it with the 2022 Arcaea song contest and honestly the rest is history for me. My main drive after that has just been getting better and striving for quality over all things. I do music for myself before anything, so making things I'm proud of is enough to satisfy me :)

What was the process like to create *Beyond Reality*? Was there a main idea behind the composition?

> The process was mainly based on my section-by-section workflow. I start by getting a main inspiration for the theme (since there was no specific instruction in that regard) then when that's laid out, I start thinking about the bigger picture. In this case since I was doing a tiebreaker, I decided on what the focus would be (a tech tb this time around) and what genres I'd put in. Then it's just a cycle of figuring out what the next section is, finding a reference for said section and making it.
> 
> From a more abstract perspective, I wanted to have some kind of sci-fi vibe going because that's what I'm comfortable with, but I took the opportunity to make the track as a homage to [Akira Complex](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/51) by referencing [Reality Distortion](https://soundcloud.com/akira-complex/vs-akira-complex-reality-distortion-original-mix) heavily in the composition and track name.
> 
> I also referenced some other smaller parts from tracks with Akira Complex, but they aren't as notable as the main inspiration.

questions

::{#lupa}::

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-04-28-5-digit-world-cup-2024-concludes/Lupa.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4722369)

> Hi there! My name's Lupa and I've been playing osu actively since 2014. I've followed tournaments like OWC since then but have been especially involved in 4/5 digit tournaments since 2021, playing in about 35 tournaments myself and hosting 3 with a 4th on the way.

[Lupa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4722369) stepped up to the of admin for 5WC 2024, as well as selecting the beatmaps that players can use in their matches (a process known as *mappooling*).

---

For people who are new to tournaments, what might go into the roles of "administration" and "mappooling"?

> Tournament administration is a really loaded role because as a host you're responsible for each and every facet of a tournament player's experience. Referees, streamers, commentators, gfx artists, mappers, all of these roles have to be managed effectively by the host otherwise the tourney won't run smoothly.
> 
> The process starts long before the actual forum post drops as well; usually a timeline is laid out that has each and every round planned for, as well as having time set aside before each round of pools is released to make sure that mappools are of high quality, balanced difficulty, and overall just fun for the players to play.
> 
> Honestly I could talk for hours about the intricacies of pooling, but the overall goal is to have each skillset in osu! represented as accurately as possible in terms of how many players play that skillset (for example: TONS of people play things like raw aim and streams/speed, but not very many play low approach rate reading with Hidden, and because of this most pools should have more aim than reading).
>
> You also have to pay close attention to difficulty balance too, because while Bancho star rating is actually really good for an automated system, that number that's shown isn't always accurate (I don't know anyone who would say [this difficulty of *Make a Move*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/765778#osu/1627148) is anywhere near as hard as [this diff of *Mononoke*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1280194#osu/2733296)). Because of this, a **lot** of care has to go into pooling, since too much of one skillset or another can tip towards one team or another in an unfair way.
> 
> To me it was a very intimidating process at first, but as time has gone on it's become more enjoyable than playing the game itself at times!

Have there been challenges in running 5WC that were specific to it, or have there been things to worry about that were common to many tournaments you've staffed in?

> There's always lots of challenges that arise when running a tournament, from scheduling conflicts between international teams to making sure deadlines are met in preparation for the actual matches. In terms of 5WC specifically though, one of the biggest things that you don't have to deal with in other tournaments is the sheer number of entrants.
> 
> Outside of 100k+, this is the largest rank range with a world cup, and the amount of dedicated *tournament* players is enormous, in my opinion larger than any of the other rank ranges. This year we had 2847 registrations alone, all of which were convened in one discord server and all of which then had to be directed to their country organizer to handle the tryout procedure.

What have been your fondest memories from 5WC 2024

> My favorite memory of 5WC 2024 was hearing [BlankTap](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10137131) commentate [osu! MEGAMIX](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/399575#osu/869704) as a tiebreaker in one of the first matches of the entire tournament, [#10 Brazil vs. #23 Hong Kong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzWb6NqDJg0). I had come up with the idea of using that as a tiebreaker a few weeks prior and had to do a good amount of convincing to get it into the pool.
> 
> Even though the skillset is favored towards aim in that map, it was such an intensely hype song that brought so many communities together that I thought it'd be perfect to kick off the first round of bracket because of the memories associated with it for each and every osu player around the world.
> 
> Alongside BlankTap's frankly perfect commentary and a map that came down to a 28k score difference on 2.5 million team scores it made for an insanely emotional moment that really reminds me how much I love this game and the community that comes with it <3

Where might you go from here?

> I still plan on hosting and pooling consistently! I plan on sticking around for next year's 5WC as a staff member and will also be continuing the badged [All-American Auction House](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1692273?n=1) series that has already had 2 successful iterations with the 3rd coming in June. I also plan on starting another badged international series sometime this fall with a fun gimmick that hasn't been seen yet. I stream on twitch a few times a week and I'm open to any questions regarding hosting/pooling either there or in discord dms, and if anyone needs staffing help for a tournament then please feel free to reach out and I'll try to help!

These types of tournaments are only possible because of the incredible osu! tournament community. It takes consistent contributions from dozens and dozens of people, ranging from playtesters to streamers, casters, referees, artists, sheeters, poolers... the list goes on and on. This admin team has a unique perspective in that we are the only ones who truly see everything from the months-long planning phase through to the end.

Almost all spectators have no idea how much it takes to run a world cup at this scale. The admin team is so thankful for the incredible staff team who helped make this happen.

We thank each player who gave it their all this year, ggwp!
