The NAT Gazette returns with a big bang and a bigger list of changes to cover!

![main banner](/wiki/shared/news/2024-05-01-the-nat-gazette-may-2024/nat-gazette-may-2024.jpg)

The NAT isn't dead! Neither has the long awaited batch of updates that have slowly been creeping in ever since the last issue. With a bigger emphasis placed on transparency and easing communication between the Beatmap Nominators and the general playerbase, we'd like to shift gears and focus on how users receive this full suite of updates.

While there's a lot to go through, our defacto NAT Leader [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) has prepared us a changelog in the form of a video! We encourage giving it a look to quickly be up to speed with all the changes to come.

mention cycle workflow and looking for feedback

These changes come after an extensive community discussion was held in the [BN Management subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/115). Moving on, big changes like these will be posted there as to foster a healthy discussion with everyone in the community. As the changes to come will come out in cycles, it is very important to get your feedback — Your voice matters!

## Updates

This time around we bring quite a sackful of changes. From additions in the Ranking Criteria, to sweeping changes in the way both new applicants and current BNs will be evaluated. There's a little of something for everyone.

### Communitywide changes

#### Beatmap Management subforum

As briefly spoiled before, we have created the brand new [BN Management subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/115). This subforum aims to be a place for any Beatmap Nominator to start a discussion regarding the usergroup, Ranked section, or any of the systems involved with it. This not only aims to empower BNs by giving them an outlet to express their ideas, but also for the playerbase to interact and discuss in any open post and provide feedback to the proposals.

#### Public evaluations archive

A public repository with both applications and current BN evaluations can now be accessed by anyone! The repository can be found in the [BN website](https://bn.mappersguild.com/publicarchive). The goal of this change was for applicants to have a point of reference and learn from existing applications to know what to expect! Currently, only users who opt in will have their evaluations shown in the repository.

#### Ranking criteria changes
