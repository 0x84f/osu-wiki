**[Resurrection Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1919672?n=1)**, or ResCup for short, is an annual open-rank TeamVs tournament for every player, with a max team size of 8 players, bringing a breath of fresh air to the top-tier competitive tournament scene. Every year, we release many customs - both songs and maps, with the goal of creating unique challenges for the players competing in the tournament. You may want to watch the following video, showcasing our notable custom songs from the 2023’s iteration, and expect even higher quality of production to this year’s iteration:

## What's new?
Compared to 2023’s iteration, the match procedure and rescheduling stayed the same. However, we do have a lot more surprises this time around. Many new mappers and artists joined our production team to bring you over 20 memorable custom songs and over 80 beatmaps designed and fine-tuned by experienced mappoolers and tournament players as playtesters. You can head over to our **[website](https://www.rescup.xyz/)** to find out more details about the overall mappool structure, as well as other related rules.
