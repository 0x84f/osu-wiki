Resurrecting all osu! players! Resurrection Cup is back for our 2024 iteration — now with tons of improvements behind the scenes, focusing on competitiveness and enjoyment for everyone!

**[Resurrection Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1919672?n=1)**, or ResCup for short, is an annual open-rank Team Vs tournament featuring teams of up to 8 players each, bringing a breath of fresh air to the top-tier competitive tournament scene. Every year, we release many customs — both songs and maps — with the goal of creating unique challenges for the players competing in the tournament. You may want to watch the following video, showcasing our notable custom songs from the 2023’s iteration, and expect an even higher quality of production to this year’s iteration:

## What's new?
The match procedure and rescheduling method for the tournament remains the same as the 2023 iteration. However, we do have a lot of surprises up our sleeve this time around. Many new mappers and artists have joined our production team, bringing you over 20 memorable custom songs and over 80 beatmaps designed and fine-tuned by experienced mappoolers and playtesters. You can head over to our **[website](https://www.rescup.xyz/)** to find out more details about the overall mappool structure as well as other relevant rules.
