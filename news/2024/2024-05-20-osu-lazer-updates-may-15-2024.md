### Smaller changes

- **Various performance improvements.** The osu!framework is constantly worked on by the devs to assure adequate performance is reached on as many systems as possible.
- **Slider head hits won't show up in the timing distribution graph with Classic mod.** This fixes an issue whereby the timing distribution graph had overlapping elements due to slider head hits being judged differently depending on whether the Classic mod was used or not.
- **Country flags can now be hidden.** Upon user demand there is now a toggle in the settings to replace all flags in-game to the placeholder flag icon.
- **Startup volume has been reduced for new installations.** There is now one less game in the world that blows your ears off when running it for the first time.
- **New maps have been added to the "recommended beatmaps" pool.** When selecting the "get recommended beatmaps" option in the setup wizard you will now get random [Mapper's Guild](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) beatmaps next to classic maps from osu!(stable).
- **Word filters are now working in osu!(lazer).** Whether it's a multiplayer room or a chatroom, explicit language will automatically be filtered out.

### New osu!mania touch input system

Further steps are being made in order to accommodate mobile players when it comes to osu!mania, a starting step here is a new touchscreen input system. Unfortunately for the time being the actual on-screen buttons are not editable, but the goal is to allow for full customisation at some point.

### Changes to skinning

Per the community's requests, skinning has been expanded upon with this update. First off, the skin editor button has been moved from the settings to the main menu (`edit` > `skin editor`), where it's easier for players to find and access it.

Next to that, hiding the HUD during gameplay will no longer hide skin elements that are in the playfield layer, which allows greater flexibility for players to choose what essential elements (such as the hit error graph) need to stay even if the HUD is hidden.

Last, but not least, skin elements will now have their anchor follow the origin when being placed, which means that elements should remain where you placed them in the editor even after the resolution changes (e.g. exiting the skin editor into gameplay).

### osu! logo updates

After the initial implementation of the new osu! logo with the highly controversial dot in the "o", a raging debate sparked within the community whether it should be removed or kept as is. In the end, the dot has been removed, and slight adjustments have been made to the logo.
