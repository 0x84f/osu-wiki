### Smaller changes

- **Various performance improvements.** The osu!framework is constantly being worked on by the devs to assure adequate performance is reached on as many systems as possible. Among those is a bug fix in the Direct3D renderer, so please give it a try if you've had issues with it!
- **Slider head hits won't show up in the timing distribution graph with Classic mod.** This fixes an issue where the timing distribution graph had multiple colours (many judgement types) on the same columns with Classic mod enabled.
- **Country flags can now be hidden with a placeholder icon.** Upon user demand, this is for content creators who experience issues in some jurisdictions due to laws about flags. We're no vexillologists or lawyers, but it's safe to say flag laws can be tricky.
- **Startup volume has been reduced for new installations.** There is now one less game in the world that blows your ears off when running it for the first time.
- **Word filters are now working in osu!(lazer).** Whether it's a multiplayer room name or a chat conversation, explicit language will automatically be filtered out.
- **Hiding the HUD during gameplay will no longer hide skin elements that are in the playfield layer.** This allows greater flexibility for players to choose what essential elements (such as the hit error graph) need to stay even if the HUD is hidden.
- **Skin elements will now have their anchor follow the origin when being placed.** If you're confused about what anchors and origins are, [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) explains this with visuals at [0:40 in the above video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0SWx_n_AeQ&t=40s).

### New osu!mania touch input system

Further steps are being made in order to accommodate mobile players when it comes to osu!mania. A starting step here is a new touchscreen input system. Unfortunately for the time being, the actual on-screen buttons are not editable, but the goal is to allow for full customisation at some point.

The random maps have the following selection criteria:

- Licensed song
- Between 60 ond 240 seconds
- Includes Easy/NormaI/Hard/Insone difficulties
- Background is explicitly permitted as okay to use in osu!
- No explicit or AI content
- No repeating songs (within each mode)

### osu! logo updates

After the initial implementation of the new osu! logo with the highly controversial dot in the "o", a raging debate sparked within the community whether it should be removed or kept as is. In the end, the dot has been removed along with some slight adjustments.
