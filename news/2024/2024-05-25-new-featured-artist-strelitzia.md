Inspired by a mix of math rock and emo tunes, **Stretlizia** emerged in 2015 and made a name for themselves alongside some of our own Featured Artists like [glass beach](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/113) and [Michael Cera Palin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/182). Today, that name is spreading to osu!.

Hailing from Phoenix, Arizona, **Strelitzia** is group of four lifelong friends (one of which is [an osu! player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4057967)) who went from performing covers at open mic nights to producing their own full-length album!

**13** complex rock tunes are part of [**Strelitzia**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/421), all pre-timed more extensively than any template reasonably should be. When you download any `.osz`, you'll know what we mean.

Experience what **Strelitzia** has to offer:
