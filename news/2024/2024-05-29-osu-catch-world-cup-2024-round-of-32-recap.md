As the qualifiers concluded, the top 32 teams that would battle it out for the title of osu!catch world cup winner were announced. Top of the pack is the big favorite to win it all this year, the United States, qualifying 1st for the second year in a row with 7 top scores out of 9 maps. Joining them on the qualification podium this year are Poland and Finland, both teams getting their best qualification result to date.

Going further down the list, we see Estonia qualifying 32nd just right above the cut off for the first time in ten years. Iceland, the sole debutant of this year, defied all expectations and ended up 30th on the qualification list and are making their world cup debut in the round of 32.

Let's get into the results and the highlights of last week's matches.

## Match highlights

### ::{ flag=SE }:: Sweden vs. ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia

Starting off the weekend early on Saturday, Sweden faced off against Australia. Sweden, seeded 14th, has joined the tournaments with high hopes as their roster this year managed to acquire their best qualification result since the format was introduced in 2022. However, their adversary Australia has managed to end up in the top 16 of the three past world cups and therefore isn’t to be underestimated.

Australia managed to convert their own pick on [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184033#fruits/4615512) into a point and were also able to grab a first breakpoint against Sweden on their [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184059#fruits/4615567) pick, V-Pop. To make matters worse, Australia were able to also win the next two maps [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2183882#fruits/4615165) and [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184044#fruits/4615540) to already put themselves on match point. Sweden, the higher seed in this encounter, were with their backs against the wall but were able to grab a breakpoint of their own on Australia’s [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184049#fruits/4615549) pick. However, they were not able to stop Australia on their second match point as they won [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184054#fruits/4615557) with a double FC from [Beerus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5529199) and [TheTixTop](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19236870), ending the match in 5-1 in favor of Australia.

Sweden will drop down to the loser bracket where they will face Iceland in the round of 16, whilst Australia continue their run in the winner bracket and are preparing themselves for a matchup against Finland.

### ::{ flag=CN }:: China vs. ::{ flag=NL }:: the Netherlands

Another matchup on Saturday saw three time world champion China, albeit with a newly revamped roster, take on the Netherlands. The Netherlands have made a name for themselves as giant killers after their amazing comeback and match victory against top seed Indonesia in the 2023 World Cup and many expected them to achieve a similar feat this year against team China.

The Netherlands took an early 2-1 lead and were on the brink of winning the next two maps as well. However, on both [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184097#fruits/4615639) and NM3, China were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat as they overtook the Netherlands twice in the ending sections of both maps. Not too demoralized by their two losses, the Netherlands tied things up at 3 a piece going into the last pick of each team. China were able to win on their [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184055#osu/4615558) pick even when the Dutch star player [b-a-d-s123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3656717) SS’ed the pick. Going into the final pick of the match, the Netherlands opted to go DT1 and drafted a roster of [Dutchman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10552580), [Sartan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4100941) and b-a-d-s123. They start off really well and build a substantial lead of 13.000 points going into the last 20 seconds of the map. They’ve lost MM2 in the ending sections of the map, they’ve lost NM3 when it was already in the bag, surely they won’t lose now, right?

In a absolutely dramatic turn of events, a single drop from the Dutch team overturns their lead in the final seconds of the map, giving China a 5th point on the board and securing them the victory. Heartbreak for the Dutchies.

### ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina vs. ::{ flag=DK }:: Denmark

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

To close out the weekend on Sunday, seed 7 Argentina took on seed 26 Denmark. Argentina, fielding the highest ranked player in the entire tournament [-Story-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283), were caught by surprise by team Denmark as Denmark was able to convert the first two maps into two points. Denmark found a surprising weakness in the Mixed Mod bracket on the Argentinian team and utilized it to perfection. However, before the third map started, the veteran for the Argentinian team [VelperK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/348467) joined the lobby. VelperK’s first appearance in the osu!catch world cup dates back to 2013 and he used this experience to absolutely obliterate the entire lobby for the next 30 minutes. He started off with a full combo on NM1, then proceeded to SS HR1, before continuing on and full combo-ing the remaining three maps to close out the match 5-2.

## Round statistics

We end this recap with a couple of interesting statistics to share:

- ::{ flag=RU }:: [KitsunIvy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7055384) and ::{ flag=AR }:: VelperK both managed to full combo all 5 maps they played in this round, both remaining missless for the bracket stage of this CWC.

- ::{ flag=US }:: [Lexii}(https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7226149) managed to top the performance leaderboard on both the qualifiers and the round of 32.
- We saw a couple of triple FCs over the weekend, such as Chile on HD1 and Netherlands on HR1, however team Argentina was the sole team to note a triple SS this weekend, achieving this incredible feat on [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184034#fruits/4615516).
