It's a rare sight to see the community push osu! into new media. While the [last community osu! manga project](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-11-20-the-first-osu-manga-osu-combat-championship) is yet ongoing, this time we get to see a complete train-themed story thanks to CONTRIBUTORS.

If you've at all followed Corsace in the past, you may have noticed that they have a mascot, affectionally called *secretary-chan* by fans. This is a story about her and the legacy she's leaving for *Chloe*, the new poster girl of Corsace.
