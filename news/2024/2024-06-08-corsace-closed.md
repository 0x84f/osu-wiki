16 qualifying players, all no strangers to the highest echelons of competitive osu!, were pitted against each other between April and May. The stage was a [mappool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OoI_ZYh9TDTSaljTMgfI3pyfxXom_xoC01mXqz1fc7M/edit#gid=175106588) featuring challenging beatmaps interspersed with classics of community-wide collective memory.

With the final showmatch of the tournament concluded, today might be the perfect time to unravel the unique audiovisual competitive experience that was Corsace Closed 2024.

Congratulations to [maliszewski](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961), [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450) and [enri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8640970) for clinching the top 3 spots.

Due to unfortunate circumstances, the Grand Finals match could not be played as scheduled. However, spectators excited for a legendary showdown between tournament titans [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450) and [maliszewski](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) were not let down, because a showmatch was able to happen and everyone was able to see what would've happened were they to fight for all the marbles:

The result? A grand rerun of most songs in the mappool using cumulative points (i.e. all scores on all maps summed together) to decide the victor, which turned out to be [maliszewski](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961).

The Corsace Closed experience wasn't only comprised by the ending. In case you missed the streams, the [Corsace YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Corsace) has compiled a [playlist of ~15 min highlights from each stage](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEl1E3ToUuS2brmDLF0EWE2hCrsmg-mHn):

It's a rare sight to see the community push osu! into new media. While the [last community osu! manga project](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-11-20-the-first-osu-manga-osu-combat-championship) is yet ongoing, this time we get to see a complete train-themed story thanks to CONTRIBUTORS.

If you've at all followed Corsace in the past, you may have noticed that they have a mascot, affectionally called *secretary-chan* by fans. This is a story about her and the legacy she's leaving for *Chloe*, the new poster girl of Corsace.
