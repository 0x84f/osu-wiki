Mathematics experts may have noticed that there are only 3 songs above. The remaining 10 tunes are waiting impatiently in [**xiiiac13**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/423) for someone (like you) to adapt them into beatmaps.

If you can't wait for more music to be added to our library, take a week long nap to wake up for our next Featured Artist reveal!

Stay tuned.
