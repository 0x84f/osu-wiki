If you've stared at digital drums or fruits for longer than the average person, you're a perfect fit for this mapping contest. Set your sights on making a top-tier osu!taiko or osu!catch map, then maybe one day you can join the fabled *Elite Mappers*!

Never heard of the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*)? To the surprise of many, it's a beatmapping contest that runs each month.

This month, we're focusing on **osu!taiko** and **osu!catch**. If you're an osu! or osu!mania mapper, please proceed to the marked exits.

This article is LONG, so we've split it up into a few sections:

- Results for [March's MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-03-23-monthly-beatmapping-contest-march-2024)
  - [osu!taiko results](#osu!taiko-results)
  - [osu!catch results](#osu!catch-results)
- [**Criteria for this month's MBC**](#game-modes)

## Beatmapping

### Limitation/theme

A *monthly* mapping contest would be pretty boring if we didn't do anything special. That's why we have *limitations* and *themes*.

These are essentially mapping prompts that limit your mapping options (and *hopefully* boost creativity in exchange!)

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) (for osu!taiko) or [Kimitakari](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=4741164) (for osu!catch).

#### osu!taiko

No more slider velocity gimmicks. You've had enough of those.

This month's osu!taiko theme is more song-focused: **you must map a song with a swing beat.**

A "swing beat" is basically any song that feels like this:

<audio controls>
    <source src="/wiki/shared/news/2024-06-11-monthly-beatmapping-contest-june-2024/swing.mp3">
</audio>

If you're unsure if a song fits the theme, [ask Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976), since he chose this theme! And of course, keep in mind that all [songs for the Monthly Beatmapping Contest](#songs) must be part of [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists)!

#### osu!catch

While osu!taiko has dropped slider velocity gimmicks, they had to go somewhere.

This month's osu!catch limitation: **slider velocity changes are not allowed.**

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

And of course, for osu!taiko, the song must have a swing beat.

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation/theme](#limitation/theme):**
  - **osu!taiko:** you must map a song with a swing beat
  - **osu!catch:** slider velocity changes are not allowed
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).** If you're creating an osu!taiko map, keep [the theme](#limitationtheme) in mind!

- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).**
