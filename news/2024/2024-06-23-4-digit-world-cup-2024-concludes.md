## Summary

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-06-23-4-digit-world-cup-2024-concludes/podium.jpg)

Congratulations to the United States for making 4WC history by being the first claim the title of champions twice in a row, as well as being the first team to garner three total 4WC wins. The United States had their strongest showing to date in this iteration of the tournament, only losing 10 points total in their 6 matches. Canada put in a strong effort, but there was never a moment where the United States was on the backfoot, and with half of their team being new to the roster, their depth remains unmatched.

As for our other podium contenders, we have Canada and China, whose roads have been intertwined since the beginning of this tournament. They faced off in RO16 first, where China eked out a 5-3 victory for a massive upset against the 3rd seed, which was only foreshadowing for the future. China then went on to, as the 14th seed, dominate the 6th seed Brazil and have an all out war with the 2nd seed South Korea, being able to consolidate after 5 breakpoints in a row. This was their first time on the podium, and a massive improvement from their placement the year prior. As for the Canadian side, the early loss to China meant that they had to play the most potential matches in losers bracket, winning 7 matches in a row to claim their #2 slot once more.

## Match highlights

In most tournaments, the first-round matchups typically don't feature massive upsets or many close matches. However, in this year's 4WC, things heated up right from the start. There were numerous seed upsets left and right, especially on the first day of matches. The most exciting and surprising match certainly was Chile vs. Spain.

The situation was clear: Chile, seeded fourth in qualifiers, were the clear favorites to win against Spain, who were seeded 29th. But as the Round of 32 has shown so far, no match-up is impossible to win or lose, and this match was the prime example.

Both teams' first picks turned out to be great choices leading to a 1-1 scoreline. Spain's second pick, however, didn't go as planned and Chile took away a breakpoint on NM2. They looked to consolidate the point with NM5, a low AR rhythm map, which on paper heavily favored the Chliean roster. Spain, despite having banned the other low AR map of the round, managed to put up a great team performance and took a breakpoint right back tying the match. After Spain won their next pick and went up ahead 2-3, a NM4 pick from Chile went down to the wire, and a great performance from M A N O L O sealed yet another breakpoint for Spain with a narrow 40,000 score gap, bringing them to match point. For Spain's last pick, they secured the win on DT1 with another relatively close lead of 150,000, knocking the 4th seed Chile down to the lower bracket and advancing to face 21st seed Taiwan in the Round of 16. Taiwan had also pulled an incredible upset in their match, defeating the 12th seed Japan.

### Semifinals: ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea vs. ::{ flag=CN }:: China

### Grand Finals ::{ flag=US }:: United States vs. ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada

## Interviews

Here are some wise words from a few people involved in various aspects of the tournament.

> Hi, I'm BOOM MEGA WIN, but you're probably more familiar with me as Jimarrah. I've been playing tournaments since May 2020, spending a majority of my time in the 4 digit scene. Recently I've been taking the game more casually, but 4WC 2024 was a big opportunity for me to compete again.

**BOOM MEGA WIN** (a.k.a. Jimarrah) competed for the title as a first-timer on the Canadian roster and with the help of his team finished in second place.

*How did it feel to face off against the United States in Grand Finals, knowing that Canada had lost against them last year already?*

> Before going into Grand Finals, we knew that USA was going to be the team to beat for a spot at the top. The heartbreaking defeat on tiebreaker last year gave us hope that USA was a contestable, and beatable team. Knowing this, we put our best effort into preparing for the weekend. We knew that gimmick was going to be our crutch, and main focus in our picking strategy. One breakpoint could be the single deciding factor in the match, and any mistake could have a grave cost. In the end, we still lost the hard-fought battle, but USA's paramount performance was absolutely deserving of the win. After the match, we were still in high spirits. We still knew that second place was something to be proud of and that we had an amazing run through the tournament.

*Losing in the Round of 16 against China surely was a massive hit. Have you had any doubts in yourself, your team and how did you manage to bounce back together with your team?*

> This year was an extremely competitive year for 4WC, with a majority of teams and players having major improvements since 4WC 2023. We knew that underestimating the bracket could result in an upset and Canada dropping down to the loser's bracket earlier than expected. With this in mind, Canada started the match against China by picking NM2: Yousei Teikoku - Zetsu [LMT's Extra], one of our least confident picks due to a core member oversleeping the match. However this was an oversight, as China's stellar performance led to us immediately losing a breakpoint. We knew that we were underprepared, and we payed for that.
> 
> Following the match, Canada knew that we did not perform up to standards as a team. In spite of that, I did not have any doubt in myself or my team. China had an amazing match, and we underestimated them. It might be a bold claim but I think we deserved to lose in that moment. We knew that we needed to prepare better. Our first step, was to tell the oversleeper to set more alarms and make sure they could hear phone calls. You can never be too sure that the bed isn't extra comfy in the morning. In the following weeks, we made sure to practice together as a team to ensure more confident rosters on every map. Otherwise, we moved on. The match didn't really have an effect on us mentally and we knew that we could win with better preparation.

> Hello, I'm BlankTap. I'm a bit of a tournament player and recently more known as a commentator, probably one that gets a bit too excited at times. I've been commentating actively for one and half years now and had the chance to contribute regarding 4WC's casting.

**BlankTap** has been making a name for himself in recent years thanks to his high-energy commentary, and he was an integral part of the casting team during this year's 4WC.

*What were your thoughts participating in your first world-cup-style tournament as a commentator? How did you prepare yourself?*

> I was very excited and basically in disbelief. The overturning of what's initially a rejection of my commentating application energized me up to prove that this will not be a decision to be regretted upon. I really do want to say thank you and that I am eternally indebted to those who believed in me that made this possible.
> 
> Regarding preparation, I don't think I can explain much other than that I basically did nearly nothing. I've only discovered the archetypes of commentating recently and while this wouldn't fly when you're an analyst or a color caster, play by play casting needs much less intricate knowledge of a team's strategy or skillset and rather how the current map will go in which I do play some of the mappool for fun and I do have some knowledge regarding how a map generally would go for various skillset from the experience I've accumulated as a tournament player myself. In short, my preparation consists of filling up my water bottle, sitting comfortably in my chair, and going hard when the moment needs it to be.

*This year's 4WC had a lot of upsets in the earlier rounds. Do you believe that this is something that could happen more frequently from now on and does it make commentating more exciting for you?*

> Regarding the plentiful early round upsets that were witnessed in this iteration, it really has to do with how the earlier rounds consists of lower star rating maps and the big focus on a player's consistency rather than their skillcap. I do think that every country is as good as each other up until a certain star rating. There are no safe rounds in a world cup where every nation sends in their best of the best. High seeding is nothing more but an intimidation factor if you don't back it up.
> 
> Nonetheless, teams do get high seedings not without a merit. I don't think upsets are something that will happen more often but only as often as or less than it is now. If upsets do spike up in quantity, it is only because of an erroneous early round pooling that deviates completely from the qualifier (Ex. speed qualifier into full gimmick RO32). Of course, its frequency is not what makes an upset exciting. We all love an underdog story, the David against the Goliath, this is no exception especially when it comes to a tiebreaker. At that point, the audience and the casters have won regardless of the result.

> Before I start my introduction, I would love to share my gratitude towards the 4WC 2024 staff for the opportunity to let me be involved with their event, and also for the participants and their positive feedback towards my maps which boosts my confidence on this. I thank you, really.
> 
> I'm Shurelia, a catch player (despite being involved in mapping for standard tournaments) since 2012 and also a GMT since 2014. I've been actively mapping for standard since 2014 and finally got into tournament mapping in 2023.

**Shurelia** has been, despite being an osu!catch player, making tournament maps for osu! for a while, including a total of three for this year's 4WC.

*What brought you into mapping? Why have you decided to create custom maps for tournaments such as 4WC 2024?*

> The reason why I started mapping for osu! standard specifically was due to being a heavy convert player in catch and wanting to gain #1 on a song that I really like. But the reason why I WANT to be better in mapping is because I got captivated by [Lan Wing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/467860)'s beatmap of [t=NODE - Four Seasons](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/285718#osu/645242). This map moves me so much that I randomly shed tears despite having no clue about osu! standard at all due to how beautiful the map and the song is.
> 
> I decided to create custom maps because I just love watching people playing my maps, moreover when it's in a big tournament such as 4WC 2024. It also lets me learn many things to improve my mapping knowledge gameplay wise by learning what the players think about my map when they try it, because as I mentioned, I do not play osu! standard at all and thus it's obvious that I don't testplay my own maps at all. Custom mapping is such a good way to improve myself, at least that's what I'm thinking.

*How does it feel to have your maps be played in high-stake tournaments? Does it motivate a mapper to follow the tournament more closely or only if their map is played?*

> It feels great! Unfortunately, due to my circumstances, my interest with osu! standard tournaments isn't as high as people might think and thus I only watch a match if my map got picked so I can see how the chat or the players reacted to it.

## Statistics

uhh need to figure out what to put here
