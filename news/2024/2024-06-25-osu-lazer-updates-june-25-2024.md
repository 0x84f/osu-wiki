## Editor changes

- **The timeline toggles controls have been moved.** After community feedback the options have been moved into the `View` dropdown menu, giving more space for the actual timeline.
- **Editing per-node slider hitsounds has been added.** Another small change that aids the current goal to achieve feature parity between the two versions of the game.
- **Breaks are visible in the editor, are automatically generated, and can be manually added or amended.** <!-- i have no clue what to write this seems self-explanatory -->
- **The positional snap grid spacing, rotation and position can be edited.** Fans of grid mapping can rejoice! This change opens many possibilites for mappers to implement more abstract concepts to their maps directly within the editor.

## Other changes

- **The rank display skinning element has been added.** One small step for osu!(lazer), a giant step for the skinning community.
- **Basic support for pass and fail storyboard layers have been added.** This means that the storyboard will change based on the amount of health you have during gameplay.

- **Traceable mod is now ranked in osu!(lazer).** For now the pp multiplier will be the same as Hidden, but that's bound to change in the future.
- **Judgments are now visible and properly displayed for the Magnetised, Repel and Depth mods.** Judgments when playing these mods were previously hidden due to inability to properly display them, but are now back in their full, judgmental glory.
- **Constant Speed mod has been added for osu!taiko.** This mod was previously only available in osu!mania, but has now been added to Taiko as well after community feedback.
- **Relax mod has been implemented for osu!taiko.** Staying on topic with Taiko, the Relax mod is now available for it, meaning you can play maps without having to worry about which buttons you are hitting.
- **You can now change the speed modifier for mods with shortcuts.** Press `Ctrl` + `Up` or `Down` to change speed modifiers for the last selected speed mod.
- **Daily challenges are almost ready to be released.** The devs are working hard to set everything up, and we should be seeing them on next release.
