With a knack for both [clicking circles](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17348593) and engaging eardrums, **Rose Quartz**'s Artcore tunes masterfully use violins and pianos to bring you into his fantasy domain — a domain that's not-so-coincidentally perfect for rhythm games.

**7** of those top-tier tracks are finally here! Well, more specifically they're [here in **Rose Quartz**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/429), all available for your future mapping endeavors.

Mapping isn't an easy task, so relax with this preview of [A Frozen Realm](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2129385) before diving into your own complicated map:

In case you didn't know, rose quartz is a pink mineral that symbolises unconditional love, which is exactly what you'll feel when you learn about next week's Featured Artist.

Stay tuned.
