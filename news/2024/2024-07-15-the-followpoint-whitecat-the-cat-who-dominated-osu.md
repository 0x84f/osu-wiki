Hey, did you hear that? That's the sound of a new interview! Today we are joined by WhiteCat, a top player who many remember as someone who was dominating the scene before mrekk's rise as a former rank #1 player!

So, let's get right to reading!

---

*Hello, let's start with an introduction, how would you introduce yourself to people who don't know you?*

> Hi, I'm WhiteCat, former nr.1 osu! player, now kinda retired.

*How did you get introduced to osu! and what was your first impression of it?*

> I got introduced to osu! back when MCPvP disbanded, yet I really did not like it the first time I tried it. I layed off the game for roughly a year and then came back and stuck with it 

*I know many have already heard about it, but could you please tell us how did you come up with your username “WhiteCat”, for people who don’t know that?*

> The story begins with a neighborhood black cat who used to visit us. Took inspiration from her and wanted to name myself BlackCat. As this was taken though, I opted for WhiteCat.

*Since you have some experience with leading a healthy life, do you feel like there can be a big mental and physical help by visiting a gym?*

> I think there are numerous benefits to the going to the gym. I think this applies to a lot of types of exercise though, and in the end it ties back to moving your body a lot

*What was the most memorable moment for you in your osu! career?*

> Most definitely the unban (WAS?)

*What would you say is the greatest gift that osu! has given you?*

> Probably the witchhunters. Taught me not to care and just pursue my own thing. Especially afterwards, it's interesting how life can present you something seemingly negative, just for it to turn out a stepping stone to something greater.

*What kept you playing before getting unrestricted? What was the source of your motivation?*

> I seriously enjoyed playing the game back in the day, which together with friendly competition was probably the biggest factor for my fast improvement. Still, I didnt play a lot during this time because I was lacking motivation, and also took quite a few breaks the game. 

*Have you ever experienced a time when you couldn’t play osu! mentally, and how do you deal with this feeling?*

> Not sure what is meant by this. If due to bad mindset, then sure on singular days but not for longer periods. I still think mindset is everything. You at least have to have yourself on your side.

*Since you haven’t been very active in osu! recently, what have you been doing in your free time?*

> I've been studying and also working. Not really much free time left there.

*Are you ever planning to make a face reveal?*

> Probably in the future sometime. Though I have to say I have not regretted not having face revealed and I appreciate my privacy.

*What other rhythm games (or osu! game modes) besides osu! have you played?*

> It went like this: Geometry Dash - osu! mobile - normal osu!

*Who would you say are the best osu! player(s) at the moment and why?*

> I'm pretty out of loop currently, so I don't know a lot of the new top players. mrekk got that phenotype though.

*Is there any advice that you would give to people who are just starting out?*

> Enjoy game.

*Will you ever attend some IRL tournaments? Like The Roundtable for example.*

> Possibly, maybe even likely.

*What is your favorite score that you’ve ever set and which score would be your “dream” one to set in the future?*

> It is tough to choose one, yet my all time favorite might just be revolutionary etude, just because I could have never fathomed.

*Who would you want to meet IRL the most if you could meet any osu! player?*

> Vaxei, always been pleasant to chat with and turns out we share quite a few interests.

*To finish things up, what does the future hold for you? Do you have anything else that you'd like to mention?*

> Bike vlogs.
