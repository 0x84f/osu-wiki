## Editor changes

Continuing on from last month's set of updates, the developers put more time and effort into the editor, with many more features implemented from stable, as well as new additions made that aim to make the editor itself easier to use for both experienced and new mappers.

- **The gameplay testing hotkeys were implemented, and new hotkeys were added for slider curve types.** Bookmarks and autoplay speed are still not added as part of the testing hotkeys, but now you can toggle autoplay with `Tab`, pause with `Ctrl` + `P`, exit at initial position with `F1`, and press `F2` to exit the gameplay test at current position. As for the slider curve types, you can toggle different types with `Alt` + `1` through `5`.
- **You can now jump to specific timestamps by pasting them in the bottom bar in the editor.** This is a very small UI change that will mean a lot to mappers, especially when it comes to modding.

- **Beatmap contents can now be edited externally.** Due to the way osu!(lazer) handles beatmaps, you were not able to just open the songs folder and edit whatever you wanted, however after today, that is possible. The sounds of cheering from mapping enthusiasts can be heard around the world.

- **Exported maps made in osu!(lazer) should no longer be broken if they are imported to osu!(stable).** This is yet another step that's making mapping in osu!(lazer) closer to reality.
- **Hexagonal and circular options have been added to the snap grid.** Expanding on the snap grid editing change made last month, more options have been added which will make the mapping journey easier for both veteran and newbie mappers.
- **Various improvements have been made to the editor UI.** Long story short, timelines have been slightly reduced, colours for timing points and kiai's have been changed, and tooltips on hover have been added to make it clear to newer players what each marker and highlighted section in the timeline mean.

## Other changes

- **The ruleset selector has new samples, and some UI samples got refreshed.** See if you can spot the UI samples that got changed!

</div>

- **New "No Release" mod has been added to osu!mania.** This is effectively relax for osu!mania, completely removing the accuracy judgment from slider ends in gameplay.
- **The colour of the mod multiplier has been changed to match the mod icon background.** If a mod is increasing difficulty, the mod multiplier will now be red, and if the mod is decreasing difficulty, the mod multiplier will be green.
- **The beatmap filters overlay has been updated.** Players kept getting confused why the in-game beatmap listing didn't work properly, without realising that the "Featured Artists" filter is selected by default, so now it's been updated to be more visible.
