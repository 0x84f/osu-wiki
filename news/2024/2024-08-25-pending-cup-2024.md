The longest running annual beatmapping contest is back, and it's now on the big stage!

![](https://serocious.s-ul.eu/5xrYmTt0)

Pending Cup is originally a Chinese mapping contest, which had its first iteration in 2013 and held by [NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679). Through the past years, Pending Cup has always been a means of encouraging creative mapping and finding new talent across the entire mapping community, and it will always be the core value of the contest. This year, we are expanding even further with a larger scale and prize pool. We strongly encourage and welcome you to participate in this event!

This year's contest will be hosted by [Chaoslitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3621552), [seros](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10562853) and [Elayue](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6400861), and it is the contest's first time being an official osu! contest!

This year we have received permission to use two exclusive non-FA songs as part of our songs list. We are also revisiting our classic format of having **3** different categories of tracks: **Vocal**, **Instrumental**, and **Featured Artist**.

### Vocal Track
**qfeileadh feat.レゾナンスもえこ – アルスノヴァに喝采を** ([@qfeileadh](https://x.com/qfeileadh))
02:47 | BPM: 185

> *Immersed in art, guided by a dream, yet confined in suffering forever... This is our first song, "Ars Nova ni Kassai o" by qfeileadh feat. レゾナンスもえこ. This song was ranked 7th place in BOFXVII and has since then received considerable attention among the general rhythm game community. Yet veiled beneath its heavenly vocal and classical grandeur is a challenge posed to the contestants: the metre signature is a **little** bit irregular.*

### Instrumental Track
**∀S∀ – Assault Taxi** ([@cupchi_n0](https://x.com/cupchi_n0))
02:30 | BPM: 154

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

> *Hey, TAXI! Our second song "Assault TAXI" by ASA will give you a jazzy feeling, but in a drifting taxi rather than a midnight jazz pub. Again, this song was once ranked 15th place in BOF:ET and is catered to traditional rhythm game enjoyers. It may even evoke feelings of nostalgia from the past... Please show off your speed now! We are looking forward to being impressed by our prospective taxi drivers.*

### Featured Artist Track
**Rabbit House – Seculo Seculorum** ([@ri_neb](https://x.com/ri_neb)) 
02:22 | BPM: 210

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

> *Now introducing our last song: "Seculo Seculorum" by a familiar name to most mappers, Rabbit House! Wait, you said you've never heard of this name before? They're [Nakagawa-Kanon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/87065) or [dksslqj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/87065) on osu!, and also one of our Featured Artists. Now imagine that you are flowing through the whirl of time, alongside this piece of renaissance hardcore, steadily yet progressing... Can you keep pace with the momentum?*

**Judging Criteria:**
| Rubric | Details |
| :-: | :-- |
| Expertise (40%): | Expertise refers to how well the map executes itself to reflect the elements in the music. This reflects the technical skill of a mapper. However, in Pending Cup, judging is not modding. Although we promote maps with expertise and professionalism and care about details, Judges are discouraged from being nitpicky on small mistakes or minor unrankables, instead Judges will score in this category considering an overarching picture of the map. |
| Creativity (40%): | Creativity refers to how reasonably outstanding the map compared with the current mapping meta. A generic map with the current mapping meta or copy paste the concepts from other "famous" maps is discouraged. Pending Cup promotes creativity so the winners of PDC should guide the mapping meta instead of following it. |
| Judge's Impression (20%) | Judges can use this for extra scores or penalties for their specific comments or remarks on something in the entry. The base Judge's Impression score is set to 10, Judges must explicitly mention why they apply addition or subtraction to the score if they wish to change. |

*Judges are instructed to be consistent in their judging style across each track when judging.*
