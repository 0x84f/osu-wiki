With the first round of the osu!mania 4K World Cup concluding last weekend, it's time to look back at the Round of 32, and spotlight the best moments of the previous weekend. The first round had an explosive start with many new faces showing up, wanting to show off their skills, and make their countrymen proud.

Even though this is only the first of many rounds to come in this edition of the MWC4K, the Round of 32 selection this year already has 2 great [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals)!

As is standard at this point, the Round of 32 mappool focused around consistency and nerve management rather than pure skill, which can be reflected in the scores set by the players this past weekend. Taking that into account, some players went above and beyond by setting ridiculous scores, which we'll be talking about more below.

## Match highlights

### Hong Kong ::{ flag=HK }:: vs. ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia

Last year, Indonesia got their best ever finish with a whopping 3rd place, earning their place on the podium. The players that got there then took a final bow, and this year the country returns with a completely renewed roster, 6 new faces ready to take on the biggest tournament of the year. And their first match looked up to be an interesting one: Hong Kong was higher in seed, with some fearsome players, but not unbeatable.

If you are not able to watch the whole match, here are some highlighted picks:

- [Little Little Princess](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2234579#mania/4746363) (RC3) @ [21:18](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2232644735?t=00h21m18s)
- [Brain Rigid Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2234595#mania/4746400) (LN2) @ [46:57](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2232644735?t=00h46m57s)
- [Hebe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2234586#mania/4746375) (HB2) @ [52:10](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2232644735?t=00h52m10s)

Ultimately, Hong Kong emerged victorious. The higher consistency of [Quotient](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11313227) & [ATP Koshepen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17115114) (who both played every map in the match) lead them to an earned victory. Indonesia, not out yet, will fight on in the loser's bracket...

### Singapore ::{ flag=SG }:: vs. ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland
