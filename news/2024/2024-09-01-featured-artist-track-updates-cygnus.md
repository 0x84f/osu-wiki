A bit over a year ago, [**cygnus**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/359) took the plunge and [became a Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-05-13-new-featured-artist-cygnus). Since then, he's released album after album after album, so it's about time we officially bring **41** of those tracks into osu!.

More specifically, those **41** tracks are now part of [**cygnus**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/359)! Anything labeled as **NEW** (like the image below) is... new. Very complicated, we know.

Historically, we've announced updates to our current artist catalogue with [big batch updates](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-01-07-featured-artist-track-updates-winter-2024), simultaneously covering a bunch of artists. That format makes it pretty easy to overlook some of the awesome music being added to osu!, so we're hoping to change that with a focus on individual artist additions!

## osu! original

First off, we need to highlight the newest addition to **cygnus**'s discography: [Tree of Misery](LINK), produced specifically for this year's [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_4K)!

If you missed it on the mappool showcase today, you're in luck — it's also right here:

## Other tracks

There's a lot more music than just that, though. **cygnus** released his newest album *Sorrow Mania* today too (every track of which is here on osu! now).

Below are previews for a bunch of the tracks, plus some maps you can try out for each. Of course, all of these songs (and many, many more) can be found on [**cygnus**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/359) with the **NEW** tag, all available as timed `.osz` files and prepared for mapping.

Enjoy a barrage of music:
