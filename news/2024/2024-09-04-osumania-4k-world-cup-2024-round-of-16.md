China and Malaysia are quite familiar with each other, they've provided many classic matches before, and by coincidence they met again in this time. China has gathered a strong team in the mid-game and try to keep good consistency on every map, while Malaysia is well known as the early game being their skill set, especially for LN maps. As expected, this match was a show.

- [aespa - Supernova (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238661#mania/4757025) (RC5) @ [22:34](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238945469?t=00h22m34s) - After both teams won their protects, Malaysia got a shot at a break point. They kept extremely close for the whole map, with the gap getting as low as 230 points. In the end China ended up barely squeezing out a win by only 1092 scores.
- [Reizoko Cj - /a/](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238283#mania/4755965) (RC6) @ [33:40](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238945469?t=00h33m40s) - This map is quite technical and risky, with roll patterns and long jack combinations making it hard for even the top players to keep good accuracy. China picked this map since they were favoured in the rice category, however that backfired when they lost some accuracy in the roll parts, meanwhile the Malaysians had 3 players with no 200s, which netted them their first break point.
- [Supa7onyz feat. 5-let - Les Cadences Magiques](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238686#mania/4757071) (SV2) @ [38:29](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238945469?t=00h38m29s) - Malaysia didn't protect SV2, but China also didn't ban this map, wanting to keep the pick in their back pocket. After Malaysia picked all the LN maps, they finally decided to pick SV2, not knowing China was well-prepared for it. After keeping it close for over 60% of the map, Malaysian players suffered a small acc loss which was already enough to lose this point.
- [Taishi - Introduction (Bygone) (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238644#mania/4756987) (HB3) @ [49:49](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238945469?t=00h49m49s) - Facing the 4–4 situation with the last pick, Malaysia choose HB3, which contains hard technical and coordination parts that make it extremely difficult to keep accuracy and consistency. China arranged a good consistency line-up, and they ended up with a triple FC totalling 2,968,458 points, but Malaysia did their best and got a crazy team score totalling 2,975,706 points. With this, Malaysia secured themselves a match point.
- [Falcom Sound Team jdk - Spiral of Erebos](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1605529#mania/3279920) (RC2) @ [54:07](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238945469?t=00h54m07s) - The last pick from China is RC2, ::{ flag=CN }:: [DawnX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8534840) got an insane score 998,935, but Malaysia players did better overall, and they kept close to China's score. There was nearly no gap between both teams from start to end, but Malaysia players didn't give China any chances, winning by only 745 points with a triple score v1 SS.

Both teams performed quite well, and there were many maps where all 6 players FC'd. Most Chinese players kept insane consistency in most maps, while Malaysian players showed their developed accuracy and consistency skill sets which netted them wins on some maps that they considered a high risk. In the next round Malaysia need to face the strong United States, and China need to prepare a potential double match with Indonesia and the winner of Argentina and Canada.
