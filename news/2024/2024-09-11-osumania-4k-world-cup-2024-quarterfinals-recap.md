Honey, it's time to consume your weekly dose of World Cup recaps...

![](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_4K/img/mwc4k2024-banner.jpg)

We are slowly reaching the end stages of MWC 4K, which means the map pools are getting harder, and the top teams are getting chances to fully flex their skills to both their opponents, and the community at large. If you have not kept up with this tournament so far, now is the ideal time to get started.

This time around we're not seeing any new slots put into the mix, but that's not to say the pool hasn't stepped up in difficulty by a surprising amount! Most notably, [sasakure.UK x TJ.hangneil - raputa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242647#mania/4766767) by [[GB]V1do](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17527968) (HB1) bumps up to 242BPM, which begins to show major weaknesses for many players and their physicality, alongside [The Flashbulb - A Raw Understanding](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1632098#mania/4766799) by [Pizza69](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25285704) (RC4) really signifying the challenge behind purely technical patterning, which is no joke when uprated to 1.15x!

To round up the mappool, we've also got one new [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals)!

Many players across all game modes are familiar with the player, mapper, and artist [cygnus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/359), who goes by the name [Matrix](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5052899) on osu!, and this time around they're debuting in MWC 4K with [Tree of Misery](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242640#mania/4766759) charted by [Miaurichesu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10055648)!

With it taking up the chordjack slot (RC3) for the round, you can be sure to expect it to ask nothing more than for you to simply be accurate due to how it being arguably the most accuracy intensive pick out of all pools, thanks to the straightforward nature behind them. You definitely shouldn't underestimate the contents of the chart however, as the chart has ZERO breaks, and it only gets heavier in patterning the further you go. This, along with added stamina management makes it so the slightest dent in your score can cause a chain reaction of misses or other judgements that would take away a large lead in score.

Brazil and Mexico is a match-up viewers were excited for. Both teams are generally all-rounders, meaning that this match was anyone's game, especially with each team's seeding being #12 and #18 respectively. If you are familiar with the Brazil team from previous years, you may know that they are former winners of the Mania World Cup back in 2020 and 2021. Mexico on the other hand are more or less newcomers who made their first appearance in the main brackets in the 2023 rendition of the world cup, so if Mexico wanted to prove that they could take down any fight, this was the match that they had to win.

- [DJ SHARPNEL - KLASSIKER EINHEIT (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242540#mania/4766576) ([YuEast 2018](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13953619), LN2) @ [30:36](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2245230506?t=00h30m36s) - The score was 1–2 with no breakpoints in sight. Brazil ended up picking LN2, which contains very dense LN sections with no breaks, so stamina is needed if you want a strong performance on this beast of a map. Unfortunately for Brazil, they had a couple of slip ups at the end of the map, letting Mexico barely get the point by 2,930 score, resulting in the first breakpoint of the match.
- [cygnus - Tree of Misery](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242640#mania/4766759) ([Miaurichesu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10055648), RC3) @ [48:56](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2245230506?t=00h48m56s) - With the score being 2–4, Brazil needed to step up their game and take a breakpoint from Mexico if they wanted any chance of winning the match. Mexico ended up choosing RC3, a map riddled with consistent chordjacks throughout the map, with consistency being key. This was Brazil's only chance at winning the match, or else it could end in a disaster for them. Thankfully for Brazil, fortune was on their side this time around, managing to take the breakpoint from Mexico while not breaking a sweat.
- [Kou! - Frost Walker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242668#mania/4766814) ([guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065), TB) @ [1:13:44](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2245230506?t=01h13m44s) - Knock knock, it's tiebreaker time! This map has been brought to you by the Catch World Cup, with its custom Grand Finals tiebreaker song, Frost Walker, from earlier this year. This tiebreaker was way too close throughout the entire map, never going over a score difference of 10k. After almost seven minutes of both teams fighting through the cold atmosphere, Brazil managed to take the win with a score difference of 5,670.

Both teams played amazing this match, with each pick being so close. While Brazil managed to take the win and will be moving on to the Quarterfinals, we can't say the same for Mexico as they are now out of the tournament. We wish Brazil the best of luck going into the Quarterfinals, but for Mexico, we hope they will be able to place better next year.
