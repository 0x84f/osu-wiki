With Semifinals comes the second and last time we see two new slots put into the mix. First being Stamina (RC3), with [Black Chocolates](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1433708#mania/3401103) By [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707). The stamina pick is usually similar to the Jumpstream pick, with the big difference being that it plays differently and goes on for much longer, which is a large reason why it's named Stamina in the first place.

The final new slot is LN4, which is made to contrast LN3, which in this case was [AZISAI](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246365#mania/4775956) by [lemonguy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4693052), being very shield-heavy for this specific round.

To explain the pool difficulty (and what exactly LN4 is), it's best to let the THREE new originals from this round do the talking!

[Vortex-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4999669) has had a following for a long time, and after going over a year without any new uploads, he makes a return with [Hubris](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246389#mania/4776009) by [kaitendaentai](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/364)!

Taking up the final rice slot, it takes on a similar approach for what we've seen in previous rounds, where it's heavy on 1/4 jumpstream and has scary bursts. The bursts are all over the place, ranging from short 1/6 streams or 1/3 jack-heavy sections. Anyone whose enjoyed a Vortex- chart in the past will be sure to enjoy this one.

Our second original lands in the hybrid category. Charted by [gzdongsheng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8660315), we're brought [Void Of Altair](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246375#mania/4775984) by our own mania player, [Akiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19587411)!

With Akiri already having a large amount of originals in their catalogue, you can expect no less from this one. Being very minijack and jack heavy overall, you're thrown a heavy amount of shields, calling for a great challenge to those with good finger control, especially when having to balance out the 1/8 snaps between some long notes.

Last, but CERTAINLY not least, [Kabocha](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/345) and incredible vocalist [Aitsuki Nakuru](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/127) bring [Dear The Night I Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246380#mania/4775997) charted by [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) and [MyZterioN-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576)!

If you're at all familiar with their song Lilith, you're familiar with this. As described earlier with this being LN4, it's much more stream/snap focused, leading to smooth patterns that can have a heavy toll on your accuracy due to the nature of how staggered (just about) every release is. All long note players are sure to enjoy this one.

The losers bracket is a scary position to be in, especially late into the tournament. Two teams managed to fall into this position, being team Philippines and team Hong Kong. The Philippines had a devastating loss in the winners bracket against Chile, losing against them 6-2, and knocking them down into the losers bracket. As for team Hong Kong, they managed to win their previous match against the United Kingdom in the losers bracket after clutching up and winning the last four picks when they needed it most. As both Philippines and Hong Kong entered the World Cup stage, viewers alike knew that this was going to be one hell of a match.

- [trapman - minefield outlaw](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246339#mania/4775913) ([guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065), RC4) @ [13:53](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2250787141?t=00h13m53s) - With the score being 1-0, it was now Hong Kong’s turn to pick, and their pick was RC4, a stamina draining chordjack map with tricky patterns to break combo on. While Hong Kong was able to stay in the lead for a good chunk of the map, due to combo breaks near the end of the map, the Philippines was able to take the breakpoint.
- [YOASOBI - Idol](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246343#mania/4775926) ([0DZ0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28156707), RC6) @ [18:29](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2250787141?t=00h18m29s) - Hong Kong needed revenge from the Philippines if they wanted to stay alive and tie the breakpoints, and in an interesting turn of events, the Philippines chose RC6, a vocal stream dump map. This pick ended up being way too close with the score difference not even going over 10k, and in the end, Hong Kong managed to get their sweet revenge and take a breakpoint from the Philippines
- [Tatsh - Joker -Vocaloid ver.-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246033#mania/4775287) ([Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082), RC1) @ [58:25](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2250787141?t=00h58m25s) - It’s now match point for the Philippines with the score being 6-3. It was time for Hong Kong to make their pick, and their pick was RC1, a dense stream map with practically zero breaks. Hong Kong needed to win if they wanted to continue having a fighting chance at taking this to the tiebreaker. All was going well, until the combos broke from the Hong Kong side at the end, resulting in the Philippines taking the breakpoint, and winning the match all together.

Well… that was certainly a match you could say. However, we will have to say our goodbyes to the Hong Kong team as they are now officially out of the tournament. Your underrated performances that shocked many viewers will not be forgotten, we hope they will place better next year. As for the Philippines, they will be facing up against the almighty South Korea team who has previously dominated the osu!mania World Cup, we wish them the very best of luck tackling down a beast of a team.

### ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan vs. ::{ flag=CN }:: China

In 2022's MWC 4K , China was beaten by Japan in Semifinals, and by coincidence, they met in same round again this year. This time both teams changed a lot, China just swept Vietnam in round 1, while Japan successfully defeated Singapore without much trouble. It is well-known that Japan has a strong roster with impressive regular skill, and China players shows their great consistency in every skill set. Both teams are also strong in SV, and that ended up being the key to winning this match.

- [DJ SHARPNEL - Black Chocolates](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1433708#mania/3401103) ([Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707), RC3) @ [12:14](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2251756726?t=00h12m14s) - Japan gunned it straight for the rice picks, starting off with RC3, where they were immediately able to show dominance with ::{ flag=JP }:: [Na2303](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/31146692) and ::{ flag=JP }:: [13wiz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/33801604) getting 2 v1 SS scores, and ::{ flag=JP }:: [AFOTHER](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10242062) dropping a single 100. China tried their best to keep up, but the ratio gap kept them off Japan's back, ultimately ending up with no answer to Japan's team score of 2,987,816 points, and 1–1 as the scoreline.
- [Terminal 11 - Cold Heart Remix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246337#mania/4775909) ([Pizza69](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25285704), RC5) @ [47:16](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2251756726?t=00h47m16s) - The match was 7 maps in without any break points, making the score 3–4 for China. Japan, after picking RC 2 through 4, opted to stick to what they do best, and picked RC5. Unfortunately for Japan, China was very strong on this pick, and a miss by ::{ flag=JP }:: [AFOTHER](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10242062) near the end of the map sealed the deal and granted China their first break point, creating a point gap between the two teams.
- [t+pazolite - Beatboxer VS Trackmaker feat. KAJI & Kohey](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246368#mania/4775966) ([AlexDunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9194799), SV2) @ [01:01:12](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2251756726?t=01h01m12s) - China was on a roll after winning their first break point, making the score 3–6 in their favour. After much consideration, Japan picked SV2, a map that China had already played the day before, in hopes of turning the tides. [CrewK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604), considered by some as the best player in the world, scored 997,336 points and was ahead of the pack by a lot, however that couldn't save Japan as China's team cobbled together an amazing team score of 2,956,661 team score, securing themselves the map, and a spot in the Finals.

As seed #13, it was already a good result for Japan to arrive to the top 8. Now it is the time to congratulate China for stepping into Finals after a 6 year-long effort. Next week they will be facing another familiar team — Chile, which is a match that cannot be missed.
