If you don't recall, [Kyoku](/wiki/Contests/Kyoku/2024) was a contest where teams of mappers and music producers needed to work together and collaborate on creating both a brand-new original song, *and* a beatmap to go along with it. Inspired by [BMS OF FIGHTERS](https://www.bmsoffighters.net/), teams have spent the last **3 months** crafting their own works of art, all for a chance for become the top team and win both a prestigious badge, along with highly sought-after [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points).

With 76 total entries (resulting in 33 submitted entries) the competition was fierce, and the judges had a lot of work ahead of them. After much deliberation, the dust has settled, and we are proud to present the top 3 entries.
