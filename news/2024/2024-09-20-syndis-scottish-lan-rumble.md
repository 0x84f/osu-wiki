SSLR takes the concept behind BTMC's Roundtable series of tournaments and raises the bar massively by letting the top 16 qualify and then are flown into Scotland, Dundee to play on the big stage, this means no invitational slots, qualifiers rule all and you could be there, signups are now open and will run until the 30th of Septemeber.

Qualifiers will take place between 21st-27th October (tbd with screening period) and will put players to their very limits so only the best make it to Scotland in January.
