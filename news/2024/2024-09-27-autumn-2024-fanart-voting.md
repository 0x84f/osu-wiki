**180** entries yearn for the blessing of your own **15** votes!

Alright, you may already know the drill for this. If not, each and every one of you (the reader) is equipped with **15** votes ready to be bestowed on your favourite selection of this iteration's **180** stellar fanart entries.

To ease off the selection process for you, we've compiled all of the entries in a sleek slideshow that's backed with banger tunes from *insert song credits*:

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <video width="95%" controls>
        <source src="LINK" type="video/mp4" preload="none">
    </video>
</div>

In case you need a reminder, a selection of the top-voted finalists will be **featured on the main menu** and receive **3 months of osu!supporter**, plus the top 3 will also receive fancy bespoke **profile badges** made from their own creations.

Let's not also forget about the top 3 finalists being available for everyone as a [**limited-time selection of default profile banners**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-15-aerial-antics-art-results#new-profile-customisations)! You might want to take one last look at the current selection of banners before they disappear forever...
