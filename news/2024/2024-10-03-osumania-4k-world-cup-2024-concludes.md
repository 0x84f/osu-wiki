As the last keys are pressed and the winning team is crowned Champions, the curtains slowly close, marking the end of another amazing World Cup series.

After 8 years of podium finishes (excluding 2020), the United States were finally able to secure themselves 1st place! That however could not have happened without much heartbreak for China and Thailand, who both had never-before seen team performances, shattering previous standing records and managing to secure their first ever podium finishes with 2nd and 3rd place respectively.

Taking into consideration that this is the United States second world cup victory in a row this year (winning the osu!catch world cup in June), and that the osu! team is notoriously strong with 6 consecutive titles under their belt, will the community bear witness to a world cup Championship hat-trick?

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

Hello there, congrats on achieving the first ever top 3 placement for Thailand! Did you have any strategies this year in particular that you think contributed to this achievement?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17699745" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/news/2024-10-03-osumania-4k-world-cup-2024-concludes/_Kiruru-avatar.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-on-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17699745">_Kiruru</a></p>

I don't think we had any special strategy because the Thailand team heavily relies on our main players such as [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) and [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267), but if I have to say what made us come this far, it would have to be how much effort we put into practising to keep improving throughout the entire tournament.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/news/2024-09-30-the-followpoint-d-i-o-the-charismatic-caster/avatar-Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

Your match against South Korea was completely unexpected with your team winning 7–1. What were your thoughts going through the match and coming out on top?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17699745" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/news/2024-10-03-osumania-4k-world-cup-2024-concludes/_Kiruru-avatar.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-on-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17699745">_Kiruru</a></p>

Honestly, the result is really unexpected for us as South Korea is a team that is favoured to get top 3, and if we won we would get a guaranteed top 3 finish for the first time. So the amount of pressure we had before the match was really high, but when we played in the match, everyone was popping off, and we were able to go through the match like it was nothing. It was so much more unexpected than the result we've shown in many maps beforehand, but after we won I felt relieved and happy as it felt like all the pressure we had gone away.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/news/2024-09-30-the-followpoint-d-i-o-the-charismatic-caster/avatar-Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

If there's one memorable moment throughout the tournament that you feel is worth sharing, what would it be and why?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17699745" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/news/2024-10-03-osumania-4k-world-cup-2024-concludes/_Kiruru-avatar.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-on-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17699745">_Kiruru</a></p>

It was definitely the moment we won against South Korea, because when I started playing osu! in 2020, I watched MWC and saw Thailand getting crushed by South Korea and getting 4th place. So top 3 was like my dream for a long time, and I'm very happy that we finally were able to get it. It's like making history for our country, and I hope it will motivate both new and old Thailand players to come to MWC more in the future.

Lastly, I would like to thank the MWC2024 Thailand team for practising and making sure our top 3 placement goal came true, and thank you to everyone who supported and kept cheering us on.
