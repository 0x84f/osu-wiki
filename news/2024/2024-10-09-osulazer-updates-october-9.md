The developers are working out the kinks and preparing for the new pp rework release, but they've also been busy with other aspect of osu!(lazer), which will be covered shortly, or check out the latter portion of the video digest below:

## Editor changes

- **The edit setup screen has been completely redesigned.** The setup screen has been rebuilt from the ground up with a more stylish look, and a lot more options that mappers will find very convenient.
![add the before and after]()
- **Objects can now be added to an existing selection when control clicking them.** Very small, but also very intuitive and helpful.
- **You can now centre the grid to the current hit object and scale selected objects around the centre with the select box.** Continuing the trend of smaller, but useful changes, there have been two more changes made that improve the quality of life for mappers.

- **Hotkey hints have been added across editor menus.** Very helpful for aspiring mappers.

## Skinning changes

- **The flexibility of the skin layout editor player avatar has been improved.** Next to being able to round the edges, you can now change the aspect ratio of the element, and the avatar will automatically adapt to the new ratio.
- **Certain elements can now have their colour customised.** The default and argon song progress bar, font adjustable components, argon wedge piece and the box element all now have adjustable colours, hopefully this is just a start of the editor elements receiving more customisation features.

## Other changes

- **It's now easier to differentiate osu!(lazer) from osu!(stable) in Windows.** Going forward it'll be clearer to players which version of the games they should use to open osu! related files.

- **The chat font size has increased again.** After community feedback noting that the font size is still too small in screens like the daily challenge, the font size has been increased once more.
![]()**(add comparison image)**
- **The shuffle button has been added to the new playing overlay, and is enabled by default.** This is great news for everyone who loves leaving osu!(lazer) in the background and listening to the various tunes from their library.
