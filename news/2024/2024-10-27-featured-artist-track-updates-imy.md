When **Imy** joined our Featured Artist catalogue [4 years ago](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-09-16-new-featured-artist-imy), they had [one Ranked map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1015203). As of now, they have [over 20](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=featured_artist%3D99), and you can expect that count to increase now that more of their songs are officially part of osu!.

Specifically, there are **7** new tracks on [**Imy**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/99), each labeled with this **NEW** tag.

As awesome as all of **Imy**'s new music is, we have to highlight one of their new tracks in particular: [Lies playing Truth](LINK), an [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) produced specifically for [this year's osu! World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2024)!

Never heard of the track? That's probably because it debuted on the [live mappool showcase](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) just a few minutes ago:

### [Imy feat. Natsume Itsuki - Lies playing Truth](LINK)
