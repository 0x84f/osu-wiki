## Round of 32 summary

While it would be completely unfair to say that the Round of 32 plays out the same every year, it remains very clear that the top 32 seeds have been shaken out into their respective brackets during this round, but of course not without some surprises along the way.

The outcome of the France (#14) vs. Turkey (#19) was quite shocking! The majority of community's pick'em votes went to the French at 78.3%, but Turkey ended up on top with a decisive 5–2 result! There was also a fierce battle between neighbour seeds Brazil (#17) and Romania (#16), ending in Brazil winning with the final score of 5–3.

Taiwan (#25) also took two points from Hong Kong (#8) despite the huge gap in seeding, with the same scenario *and* score-line replicated on the same day by the Philippines (#9) and Malaysia (#24), showing that even when the underdog teams are faced with a looming threat, they won't go down without a fight.

And now without further ado, the highlight match of this week is...

### ::{ flag=CN }:: China vs. ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan

::{#scylla}::

On Saturday the community has been given a pleasure of watching a top tier match between two very evenly matched teams, Sweden (#15) and Indonesia (#18). This was not just an even matchup on paper, with the match itself becoming more intense by the minute, leading to the first tiebreaker being played in a match this year!

Sweden ended clutching the win with a final score of 5–4, and ::{ flag=SE }:: scylla, team Sweden's captain, kindly agreed to sharing a small glimpse at how a World Cup team prepared for their match versus Indonesia.

How did you and your team prepare for the match vs. Indonesia, were there any expectations the team had before the match started?

For this week we didn't do anything special in terms of preparation. We were discussing having a scrim against another country but real life plans got in the way. One hour before the match I went through our scores on our team sheet and made lineups and planned picks and bans based on their scores as well as their mental and current playing ability. With how even our opponents are to us skill wise we went into the match with very little expectations, in our eyes the win could've gone either way. Despite not having ::{ flag=SE }:: [Zpinxx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9818947) for the match, our team mental was great, we played really well, and most of our picks went the way we wanted.

What were some of the more difficult decisions made by either yourself or the team combined during the match?

The most difficult decision was our roster for [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/643391#osu/1389956). The initial lineup we planned for was changed last minute with me going HR and ::{ flag=SE }:: [Andros](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9072586) going NM, which was dangerous but worked very much in our favour. We had many plausible mod and player combinations that sounded really good on paper but the one we went with was not planned beforehand at all.

I don't have high hopes for our match against Australia. We might be able to snag one or two points but I don't see a win in sight, especially not considering how well they played against Austria. As for our loser bracket, I think there's a high likelihood we win against the winner of Singapore vs. Thailand. The match after that is most likely gonna be against either Chile or United Kingdom which will be really tough regardless who we face, but its not looking as grim as against Australia, that's for sure. Worst case I believe we place top16, which isn't that bad considering we seeded 15 this year. Best case we place top12 like last year, it's optimistic but I believe there's a small chance we make it that far, it heavily depends on how our opponents play and the maps in the mappool. Whether we make top16 or top12, I'm still gonna be satisfied with our performance this year. In my 5 years of playing OWC it has always been a joy playing for Sweden and playing with my fellow swedes, they make it all worth it in the end.
