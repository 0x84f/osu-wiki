Korean producer **WyvernP** settles into our Featured Artist library.

While **WyvernP** is best known for creating VOCALOID tracks, their talent reaches into multi-genre instrumentals too. Seasoned in practically every genre, **WyvernP** produces tunes that range from rock to pop to speedcore to artcore — and that's only considering the tracks that are officially part of osu! as of today.

[**WyvernP**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/445) is now home to **5** tracks, each pre-timed so you can create a map with one less step.
