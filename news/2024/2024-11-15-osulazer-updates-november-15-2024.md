For those who want to pause for a moment to read, here's the complete rundown:

After the [last update](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-10-09-osulazer-updates-october-9), an [update to performance algorithms](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-10-28-performance-points-star-rating-updates) was rolled out to all players. If your global rank went up, congratulations. If not, maybe it's time to get back

Below you will find [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) and [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) discussing the rollout as well as all the new neat changes in the game.

## Editor changes

- **Added keyboard shortcut for cycling grid types (`Shift` + `G`).** Did you know we have not just square, but triangular and circular grids as well?
- **Toggles and shortcuts for hitsound sample addition banks.** Seasoned mappers will likely be familiar with the `Shift`/`Alt` + `Q`/`W`/`E`/`R` hitsounding keys already, which now all work on osu!(lazer).
- **Breaks can now be hidden from the timeline.** Minor visual change for those who find this indicator distracting.

## Gameplay changes

- **Pausing is now instant when hitting the pause key (`Esc`).** This used to be affected by the "hold-to-confirm activation time" setting.
- **The time it takes to quick retry (`Ctrl` + `R`) has been decreased.** Without arbitrary delays, you'll be back in action as soon as the beatmap loads, i.e. about one second faster than before.<!-- video -->

## Skinning changes

- **New "use relative size" setting for song progress bars.** Best explained with a video:

## Other changes

- **New osu!mania ruleset selection sample.** Our audio engineer [nekodex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102) has been at it again. Take a listen:<!-- comparison -->
- **You can now search chat channels and the friends/online user listing.** Popular and social people will appreciate this one.
- **New `ranked` and `submitted` date filtering in song select.** This already existed on the website. See the [beatmap search article](/wiki/Beatmap_search) for an extensive list of filters.
- **Searching mods by acronym will highlight the corresponding mod for selection.** `F1` + mod acronym + `Enter` + `F1`. Now if only I could remember all the new mod acronyms...<!-- video? -->
- **New settings button to reset all beatmap offsets.** Useful when you realise you've set all your offsets wrong.
- **Local scores are now preserved even when deleting maps.** Quality-of-life change for maintainers of large beatmap libraries.
- **New context menu option for copying link to an online score.** The same thing exists when right-clicking beatmaps in song select, btw.<!-- image -->
- **Option sliders can now be adjusted with arrow keys when selected.**<!-- video? -->
