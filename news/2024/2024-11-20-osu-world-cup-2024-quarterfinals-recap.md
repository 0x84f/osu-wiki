The pool expanded in this Quarterfinals round, and with that size increase came some unique picks. Tackling the Big, Black elephant in the room first - yes. That is Mismagius's(https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048) original, iconic map of THE BIG BLACK(https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/41823#osu/131891) in our FreeMod pool. It was picked or banned in over half of the matches this round.

Other recognizable maps to be present include Frostmourne's(https://osu.ppy.sh/users/199669) map of IGNITE(https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/209170/#osu/492285) and CXu's(https://osu.ppy.sh/users/84841) take on the full version of Wing my Way(https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/850548/#osu/1778268), both beloved songs in the Double Time pool. The former is a staple 2014 map with aim and tapping elements done in a comfortable, yet signature style for that era, while the latter is a tough flow aim challenge when DT'd.

Switching the topic to brand-new maps, this QF pool was the debut of a couple of them, including but not limited to: the stamina and stream aim test Rebuilding(https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278182#osu/4855537), mapped by iamtickrate(https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10772580), a favorite of those who take pride in shredding long streams; the technical slider challenge of It's Our Destiny (Cuepric Remix)(https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278186#osu/4855557), a collab between Azrulk(https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046612) and Ishtiaq(https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6405262); and the reading and overlap-heavy Coffee no Aji to(https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278079#osu/4855234) by KnightC0re(https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7894340).

...oh, [and the writer of this section made a map too](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278205#osu/4855591)...

For our tiebreaker this week, we once again had a brand-new, jamming original unveiled: Whiteout(https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278209#osu/4855599) by Genkaku Aria(https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/358), featuring vocals by the wonderful KOKOMI(I don't know what link to put here, soundcloud or twitter maybe?). Adapted into a fast-paced alt and aim test by KKipalt(https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6889573) and Icekalt(https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5410645), this tiebreaker ended up being played in a nail-biter of a match between the Philippines and Ukraine, which included a fittingly close finish. Definitely check it out!

I'm very grateful to all the members who were involved in this project. All of the project members valued the worldview of the song and gave their best performance. The design, maps, video, etc. are all of high quality.

When creating the music for OWC, I placed importance on a sense of speed and the number of notes. I hope you enjoy the cold, sad, and beautiful worldview. If you haven't seen the work yet, please check it out.

I'd like to thank the osu! management for giving me this opportunity.

24 teams where whittled down to a mere 12 in this first shakedown week of the osu! World Cup, where the contenders sought to elevate themselves above the pretenders. Teams entering this stage in the losers' bracket were now forced to play two matches per week to stave off elimination.

In retrospect, the weekend went on to become in large part a showcase of the best teams flexing their muscles. The top seeds ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea and ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia annihilated their opposition in their advance to the Semifinals, while team ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany continued its historical dominance over ::{ flag=RU }:: Russia, bringing their head-to-head matchup to 7–0 over the course of World Cup history.

Meanwhile, the North American standoff ended up in a 6–2 win for the ::{ flag=US }:: United States. This rematch of their 2023 Quarterfinals bout, in which ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada pulled off one of the largest upsets in recent world cup memory, was still very close despite the misleading scoreline. The last two points were won by a combined margin of only 150,000 points, as ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada battled to the bitter end.

For the first round of losers' bracket matches, it would be ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine to pull off the only upset of the week, as far as pick'ems were concerned. After defeating ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil 6–1 despite spectators favouring them 7:3, it turned out the country that doesn't care about the odds has an osu! World Cup team to match. They would go on to end their run against the ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines, but not without showing us the undisputed match of the week — read on for a full analysis [further below](#philippines-vs.-ukraine).

In the second losers' bracket round last weekend, there were again no pick'em surprises, but the winners all stood out for their own reasons:

- ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland's 6–0 win against ::{ flag=TR }:: Türkiye completed their perfect 12–0 weekend, bouncing back from their singular point loss so far and securing a spot in the top 12, all despite having replaced over half of their 2023 roster.
- ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile took down ::{ flag=SE }:: Sweden 6–1 and look to be rounding into form as they seek to live up to expectations as the #7 seed.
- ::{ flag=CN }:: China, running back a core roster that continues to stand the test of time, swept ::{ flag=NO }:: Norway 6–0 in a surprising outcome that was truly closer than the scoreline indicated.

After all is said and done, it is with great respect that we bid adieu to ::{ flag=TR }:: Türkiye for achieving their best world cup finish ever along with ::{ flag=NO }:: Norway, ::{ flag=SE }:: Sweden and ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine at 13th–16th, as well as ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil, ::{ flag=FI }:: Finland, ::{ flag=FR }:: France, ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia, ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan, ::{ flag=RO }:: Romania, ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand and ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan for finishing their 2024 campaigns in the top 24.

The best match of the quarter finals was one you probably didn't even know about or watch because the only tiebreaker match of the quarter finals weekend was not even streamed on an official channel. With three matches all happening at once, seed 9 vs seed 22, the Philippines vs Ukraine, drew the short straw of not being streamed officially, instead getting an unofficial English broadcast.

Both teams had similar strengths but different weaknesses coming into this match, resulting in a back-and-forth slugfest. The Philippines opened with DT3 as their first pick, but Ukraine took it as a break point to start the match, consolidating with their own DT1 first pick. The Philippines tried switching gears to NM4, but with Ukraine putting up three scores above 700,000, this resulted in a 3-0 lead with two break points for Ukraine.

Momentum quickly shifted with Ukraine's next pick, the breakcore-style speed FM2. The Philippines took this map, won their own next HD2 pick with a whopping 905,684 coming from Rammu, and stole Ukraine's HR2 pick afterward with a carry performance of 839,244 from zonelouise, tying the match 3-3.

Another two very close break points followed on HD3 and NM2 with very close 200,000 score differences on both maps, bringing the match to 4-4. Both teams had saved a good last pick for this moment, with the Philippines picking NM5, the AR5 reading pick, and Ukraine picking HR3, the flow alt tech hybrid map. With the teams tied 5-5, the only tiebreaker of the quarter finals weekend was secured.

Both these teams had something to prove going into this tiebreaker; the Philippines and Ukraine both lost at least one key team member from last year, with enri and hyeok2044 leaving the Philippines and dench leaving Ukraine, so repeating or going beyond their final placement last year would prove that these teams can hold their own year to year regardless of roster changes.

With motivation pushing from behind and pressure mounting from above, the Philippines and Ukraine loaded into Whiteout for one last map. It ended up being a battle of carry players as NathanRam1918 and RafGPio found big combos at different points, and in the end, the tiebreaker went to the Philippines in one of the closest maps of the match, a 56,475 score difference.
