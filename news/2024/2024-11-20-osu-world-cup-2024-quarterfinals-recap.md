## Quarterfinals summary

It was a shake-down week in the osu! World Cup as the bracket was whittled down from 24 teams to a mere 12, and the contenders sought to elevate themselves above the pretenders. This was Quarterfinals weekend, a chance for the elite of the tournament to showcase their skills and a marathon battle for survival for those teams entering this stage in the losers bracket, forced now to play two matches per week to stave off elimination.

In retrospect, the week went on to be, in large part, a showcase of the best teams flexing their muscle. Top seeds and tournament favourites South Korea and Australia annihilated their opposition, beating Hong Kong 6–0 and the United Kingdom 6–1, respectively, to advance to the Semifinals. Germany and the United States emerged the victors of the other two Quarterfinal matchups on the winners side; Germany continued their historical dominance over Russia with a 6–3 score to make the head-to-head to 7–0 over the course of World Cup history, while the United States exorcised their demons by beating Canada 6–2 in a rematch of their 2023 Quarterfinals bout in which Canada pulled off one of the largest upsets in recent World Cup memory. Do not be misled by the scoreline, either; the USA won the last two points of the match by a combined margin of only 150,000 points as Canada battled to the bitter end.

The losers bracket would be the stage where 12 teams were eliminated over the course of the Quarterfinals week, their World Cup aspirations coming to an end. The first set of losers bracket matches for the week would play out as predictions expected, with one notable exception. Perhaps fittingly, it would be Ukraine to pull off the only upset of the week when pick'ems were concerned, defeating Brazil 6–1 despite pick'ems participants choosing Brazil by a 67.2% to 32.7% margin — a country that doesn't care about the odds has an osu! World Cup team to match. When all was said and done, we said farewell to eight teams in this stage of matches, as Finland, France, Indonesia, Japan, Romania, Taiwan, and Thailand joined Brazil finishing their 2024 campaigns in the top 24.

In the resulting potential matches, there were again no pick'ems surprises, but the winners all stood out for their own reasons. Poland defeated Turkiye 6–0, completing a perfect 12–0 weekend and earning a spot in the top 12 despite replacing over half of their 2023 roster; Chile took down Sweden 6–1 and look to be rounding into form as they seek to live up to their #7 seed expectations, and China, running back a core roster that continues to stand the test of time, swept Norway 6–0 in a surprising outcome that was truly closer than the scoreline indicated. Finally, the Philippines defeated Ukraine 6–5 in the undisputed match of the week – read on for a full analysis of this incredible battle between two countries desperate to continue on in the bracket. It is with great respect for these nations that we thus bid adieu to the teams finishing at 13th–16th; Turkiye achieved their best World Cup finish ever, while Sweden, Norway, and Ukraine all acquitted themselves honourably to finish in the top half of the standings.

The best match of the Quarterfinals was one you probably didn't even know about or watch, because the only tiebreaker match from last weekend was not even streamed on an official channel. With three matches all happening at once, Philippines vs. Ukraine drew the short straw of not being streamed. This made sense before the matches started: Russia vs Germany in the winners bracket were seeds #4 and #5 while Norway vs. China in the losers bracket were seeds #12 and #13, making these the two closest matchups of the weekend on paper, so seed #9 vs. #22 should never be as close as those. "Should" does a lot of heavy lifting in that last sentence, as seed #22 Ukraine took seed #9 Philippines to the tiebreaker point.

Both teams had similar strengths, but different weaknesses coming into this match, resulting in a back-and-forth slugfest. Philippines opened with [DT3] as their first pick, but Ukraine took it as a break point to start the match, consolidating with their own [DT1] first pick. Philippines tried switching gears to [NM4], but with Ukraine putting up three scores above 700,000, this resulted in a 3–0 lead with two break points for Ukraine. Momentum quickly shifted with Ukraine's next pick, the breakcore-style speed [FM2]. Philippines took this map, won their own next [HD2] pick with a whopping 905,684 coming from Rammu, and stole Ukraine's [HR2] pick afterward with a carry performance of 839,244 from [zonelouise], tying the match 3–3.

Another two very close break points followed on [HD3] and [NM2] with very close 200,000 score differences on both maps, bringing the match to 4–4. Both teams had saved a good last pick for this moment, with Philippines picking [NM5], the AR5 reading pick, and Ukraine picking [HR3], the flow alt tech hybrid map. Both teams won their last pick comfortably, in contrast to the 6 break points of 8 maps played before this. With the teams tied 5–5, the only tiebreaker of the Quarterfinals weekend was secured.

Both these teams had something to prove going into this tiebreaker; Philippines and Ukraine both lost at least one key team member from last year, with [enri] and [hyeok2044] leaving Philippines and [dench] leaving Ukraine, so repeating or going beyond their final placement last year would prove that these teams can hold their own year to year regardless of roster changes. With motivation pushing from behind and pressure mounting from above, Philippines and Ukraine loaded into [Whiteout], the tiebreaker, for one last map. It ended up being a battle of carry players as [NathanRam1918] and [RafGPio] found big combos at different points, and in the end, the tiebreaker went to the Philippines in one of the closest maps of the match, a 56,475 score difference.

For Ukraine, this loss marks their second year in a row finishing in the top 16 of OWC, matching their best-ever performance from last year. With only 56,476 points separating them from the top 12, Ukraine can exit with their heads held high and with hope for the future. For the Philippines, this win brings them to the top 12 for the second time in OWC history. While they have a tough road ahead of them if they want to match their top 6 finish from last year, expectations for this team coming into OWC were, in many people's minds, lower than top 12, and perhaps lower than top 16. In every competition, there are winners and losers, but this match is one of the rarest kinds; one where both teams proved their mettle, proved their doubters wrong, and proved they deserve their reputation in the osu! World Cup.
