**Kry.exe** launches into our Featured Artist collection!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/xxx/header.jpg)

It should be no surprise that the greatest rhythm game music producers are also rhythm game players. **Kry.exe** has been part of the Beat Saber community for years, both as a top player and contributor to the game's tournament scene.

**Kry.exe** is no stranger to osu! either. He produced [SENT://iNEL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2023743) for *The Roundtable II*, along with [Kaiju](LINK) in collaboration with *nm-y* for [2024's osu! World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2024), which debuted on [the tournament's livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) literally a few minutes ago.

You'll find **7** songs on [**Kry.exe**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/448), including those two iconic [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals).

And in case you missed it, here's the debut of this year's OWC Finals tiebreaker, [nm-y & Kry.exe - Kaiju](LINK):
