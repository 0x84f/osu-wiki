The Semifinals pool included some very interesting maps this time around. Fan favourite [melon boy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3053382) returned with another popular custom with [Warcry](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2281532#osu/4864391), a unique map that's over 3 minutes of non-stop aim, while also being quite taxing on the tapping stamina through its sheer lack of breaks. The comet known as [jonathanlfj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/270377) also came around for his yearly appearance, with his map of [TO MAKE THE END OF BATTLE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2281558#osu/4864433) being another instance of the popular lfj + Falcom Sound Team combo to grace OWC. DragonForce's cover of [My Heart Will Go On](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1865009#osu/3853480) by the sadly late [MakiDonalds](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11610772) was another highlight of the pool, providing a much-needed stream map and a great flow challenge. Rest in peace, Maki.

The Double Time selections were a mix of classic and new, with existing maps such as [Fallen Angel (El Poco Maro Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/36319#osu/403050) giving players a more established, standard map with a mix of aim and speed to opt for, contrasting with [Hit & Run](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2281450#osu/4864105), a very modern take on DT tech at high approach rates by rap mapping aficionado [jamesjan3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6260705).

We had the debut of 2 originals this week as well, with the first one being [VALDeS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2281540#osu/4864403), produced by the wonderful [nagiha](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/447). A jazzy swing map at circle size 6, the mix of precision and tricky rhythm was quite a tough bout for the players, put in place by [yaspo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4945926).

## Semifinals summary

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| **United Kingdom** ::{ flag=GB }:: | **6** | 4 | ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines |
| **Russian Federation** ::{ flag=RU }:: | **6** | 1 | ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland |
| **Canada** ::{ flag=CA }:: | **6** | 5 | ::{ flag=CN }:: China |

| Hong Kong ::{ flag=HK }:: | 3 | **6** | ::{ flag=CL }:: **Chile** |
| **Russian Federation** ::{ flag=RU }:: | **6** | 2 | ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile |
| Canada ::{ flag=CA }:: | 5 | **6** | ::{ flag=GB }:: **United Kingdom** |

This semifinals weekend was historic; teams rose and fell like kingdoms, and the long-standing empires once more laid claim to their promised land. Glorious leaders commanded their troops through a weekend of fierce battles where the top 12 became the top 6 and where even mother nature stepped onto the battlefield.

The first round of losers' bracket looked to be typical. Russia took down Poland 6–1, and Chile defeated Hong Kong in a tightly-contested 6–3 match, winning one map by only 107 points! This marks Poland's fourth top 12 finish in four years and Hong Kong's seventh in eight years. Poland showed their country's depth of players as Hong Kong continued to impress.

The resulting potential here would see Russia take down Chile 6–2 in the second round of the losers' bracket. Chile, having made the top 8 twice in a row, are finally solidifying themselves as a top performer after the unfortunate series of events in OWC 2021 and 2022. Russia, on the other hand, have finally broken their semifinals curse; the last time Russia finished in the top 6 was in 2019, and this roster finally made the cut.

On the other side of the losers' bracket, Canada and China fought all the way until tiebreaker, with Canada taking the last map and advancing 6–5 into top 8. China showed once more, after taking both Russia and Canada to tiebreaker, that they are not to be trifled with.

Across from this match was the Philippines vs United Kingdom, where the Philippines gave the UK some trouble, with the UK winning 6–4. The Philippines have now made the top 12 for the second time in OWC, solidifying them as one of the tournament's high performers.

This would mean that the UK and Canada would face off in the second round of the losers' bracket; read on further for more details about this one, where the UK broke Canada's top 6 streak of 6 years and made the top 6 again themselves for the first time since 2021.

Meanwhile, in the winners' bracket, Germany matched up against South Korea in an underdog match. And certainly, Germany were the underdogs; South Korea continued their 16–0 win streak and dropped no points against Germany, making them 22–0 in maps and 4–0 in matches through OWC 2024.

The two teams in the other winners' bracket match may yet have something to say about that, however. Australia and the United States faced off in the last match of the weekend, with the USA taking the match 6–4 and securing a spot in the winners' finals for the first time since 2021. Read on for more details about both Australia vs the United States and Canada vs the United Kingdom.

The moment qualifier results were released, with Australia seeding #2 and the United States seeding #3, all eyes looked toward their near-certain date in the Semifinals. After several weeks of one-sided wins each, their meeting was set, a rematch of last year's losers bracket final in which the United States ran roughshod over Australia, winning it 7–1. Australia would be out for revenge, while the United States sought to continue their historical dominance over an opposing team they had never lost more than a single map against in their three previous meetings.

Expectations for this match were sky-high, and it lived up to the billing, a back-and-forth affair in which the teams dominated their own picks to a historic level. The United States, having bolstered their roster's well-roundedness with the return of Utami and the addition of rookie Pezz, opted heavily into the gimmicky maps in the pool, opening things up with the overlap-reading nomod pick Lovely Icecream Princess Sweetie before delving into the precision flow aim hard rock pick Saika; they would win both, with Pezz and Utami their top two performers. Not to be outdone, mechanics marvels Australia simply decided to pick their way straight through the double time pool, and the Aussies would be rewarded with wins on all four DT maps, including a ridiculous 4.39 million team score on Hit & Run in the DT4 slot. Back and forth went the scoreline as neither team could pick up a break point through the first eight maps of the match, bringing the score to 4-4 heading into the teams' respective final picks. The United States' last map would be the tech nomod pick Voidcrossing, on which they excelled with all four players putting up 500k or better en route to a comfortable win.

The last pick of the match belonged to Australia. If they won, it would force a tiebreaker; lose, and the match would end right then and there with an American victory. Out of double time maps, they opted into the aim consistency nomod selection of Warcry, an incredibly popular pick the entire weekend. Neither team was any stranger to aim, with the lobby filled with some of the world's best aim players such as mrekk, cyo, rektygon, and Utami. To this point, mrekk had been having something of a quiet match by his illustrious standards; while he put up several full combos and top scores, none truly stood out in the way many expected – as one of the preeminent aim players in the tournament, what would NM1 bring for him?

Unfortunately, the answer was despair. After an early break, he was regaining combo when the lobby came to a crashing halt. It was a disconnect from the world #1, his internet having dropped at the worst possible time. The map continued on for the seven other players: unaware of what had occurred, the United States eventually won by a margin of 844,321. mrekk would not have been able to make up the difference in score, so by rule the United States won the pick and with it the match. It was a disappointing ending to a tremendous match that saw two top teams at their absolute peak, with the United States moving on to their first winners bracket final since 2021 while Australia fell to the losers bracket to fight their way through.

The teams involved in the best match of finals week each had a big question to answer. For the United Kingdom, it was whether the time had come for a return to form. UK finished third in the osu! World Cup in 2017 and 2019 and took the United States to a bracket reset grand final in 2018, eventually finishing as the runners-up, before falling out of the top 12 in 2020 and 2022 and barely eking out a spot in top 12 in 2023. By contrast, Canada reached the podium for the first time in 2020 with a third-place finish, backing it up with a 4th in 2021 and back-to-back top 6 finishes in 2022 and 2023, and they came into 2024 trying to find out if they could continue their run despite major roster changes. After wins over the Philippines and China, respectively, in the losers bracket round 4, the two would meet in a legacy battle of a potential match.

This match would be a grueling affair between two remarkably evenly matched teams. With strong tapping mechanics players on their side such as Malteser, Akolibed, Bubbleman, and rudj, the United Kingdom picked heavily into the double time pool in the early stages, winning Arrival of Tears and White Happy with their first two picks. Meanwhile, Canada's aim skills were on full display as they comfortably won their first two selections of TO MAKE THE END OF BATTLE and The Creator, showing off the consistency of members such as xootynator and PikaPwn. Canada then switched up their approach, displaying the elite hidden skills of their roster to win Acheron with their third pick. The United Kingdom responded with a massive team score on Saika, led by an FC from Bubbleman, to tie the match up 3-3.

The match took a left turn with the next two picks. Canada opted into another aim consistency map with Warcry, but they were stonewalled by a ludicrous display from Bubbleman and Mahmood, who each FCed the map, helping the UK pick up a break point, the first of the match. They would immediately give up that advantage on the next pick, as Canada managed to scrape together a 155,339 point win on DT4's awkward high approach rate pick Hit & Run.

Tied 4-4, one pick remained per team. Canada selected My Heart Will Go On and put on a flow aim clinic, winning it by over 900k. Not to be outdone, the United Kingdom simply set one of the most absurd team scores ever seen in World Cup history: a three-way FC on Fallen Angel from rudj, Bubbleman, and Akolibed, all with over 99% accuracy, backed up by a last-second choke from Mahmood to contribute another 1-million-plus score. The final tally? A score of 4,684,571, one of the highest team scores ever seen on any map in any stage, good for a 1.7 million point win at the most critical moment to force the tiebreaker.

And what a tiebreaker it would be. today is the day was the map, setting the scene for stalwarts Bubbleman and xootynator to go toe-to-toe in a furious battle to advance to the top 6. Renowned throughout their tournament careers for their consistency and clutch factor, the two put forth a dazzling display in the match's biggest moment. xootynator found the lone miss for either player at the one-third mark, and it would be all the difference the United Kingdom needed as Bubbleman held over for 2300 combo to secure a 208,784 point win for the UK. A return to glory was the reward for the United Kingdom, reaching the finals week for the first time since 2021, while it was heartbreak for Canada, eliminated outside the top 6 for the first time since 2017.
