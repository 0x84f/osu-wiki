Welcome to the recap of the osu!taiko Mapping World Cup 2024!

![](/wiki/Contests/TMWC/2024/img/banner.png)

The osu!taiko Mapping World Cup was a country-based, multi-stage osu!taiko mapping contest on a scale unlike anything seen previously in the osu!taiko scene. Across multiple rounds of mapping we crowned our winner, the best current osu!taiko mapping country!

## Commissioned songs

We had the chance to showcase some original works made specifically for this contest in the form of custom songs. While they were made for this contest, the artists have agreed that all of these songs are availble for anyone in the osu! community to map, and not just in taiko!

The first custom song revealed was Chiru-san's [Gleam](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lei5Y3aWqWMfh1k55-_wCqTl2ZAkKafQ/view?usp=sharing). This upbeat bright song was used in the first stage of the contest with the restriction that maps had to be mechanically simple. A familiar face to the osu! community also made an appearance when Xyris provided a chaotic song switching between tempos and genres for teams to sink their teeth into. Another familiar face showed up with [Sydosys](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/392) creating the song Divergence. This track shows a style that Sydosys has became synonymous with, using complex rhythms and layers allowing mappers to go wild. The last custom song was made by [Spehs](https://soundcloud.com/r4m3n50up), someone who had played osu! before but had not made their presence as an artist known before. By far the most complex song in terms of timings, this song mixes many different rhythms and rapidly changing bpms that allowed mappers to demonstrate their skills.
