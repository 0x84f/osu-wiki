While the community has been indulging themselves to some top of the line osu! gameplay for the past few weeks, the developers stayed hard at work, making osu!(lazer) even better.

### Editor changes

- **The visual appearance of highlighted osu!mania notes has been improved.** Cleans up some sub-par bounding boxes for objects, and makes selections easier to see.
- **osu!mania notes won't disappear when reaching their hit time.** Another small annoyance that didn't make sense in the editor.
- **Some default settings for beatmaps have changed.** Namely, `Enable countdown` and `Samples match playback rate` options are disabled by default, matching osu!(stable).
- **Objects will stay selected if you control-click on empty space.** If your aim is lacking, we have you covered (in the editor).

### Gameplay changes

- **The idle time before gameplay loads has been increased when hovering controls.** Now there's more time to ponder whether the background dim percentage is just right.
- **A toggle has been added for star fountains during gameplay.** No more star fountain jump scares.

- **Your score will be saved even if you quick-restart after passing a map.** R.I.P. to all the sub-par runs that could've been saved so far, at least until they've been superseded.
- **The "watch replay" button now works on first press.** No, your mouse wasn't broken after all.
- **A new osu! gameplay mod has been implemented, "Bloom".** They say everything's bigger in... osu!(lazer)?

- **Stage line alignment in osu!(lazer) now matches osu!(stable).** It's small things like these that can make all the difference for players.
- **You can now get an SS in osu!mania even if there are GREAT judgements.** It's big things like these that *do* make all the difference for players.
- **The scroll bar for adjusting osu!mania scroll speed is now more granular.** The speed can now be adjusted with single decimal precision.
- **osu!taiko's constant scroll algorithm has been adjusted.** The speed more closely matches player expectations.

### Other changes

- **You can now install osu!(lazer) directly from osu!(stable)'s cutting edge release.** While not necessarily an osu!(lazer) change, it shows that slowly, but surely, osu!(lazer) is getting into a state ready for major transition.

- **The public chats are now sorted alphabetically, and private chats are sorted based on recent messages.** Order has been... added?
- **Your rank is now accurately presented based on the mode you are playing.** Previously only the rank of your default game mode would be visible in-game.
- **Playlists can now be closed within a grace period after creation.** If you spot a mistake or change your mind on a playlist within the first 5 minutes, the playlist can be closed with the new `Close` button.
- **Hold-for-pause during gameplay has been re-added.** This time it's a toggle, meaning that sometimes you *can* get the best of both worlds.

- **A map's maximum achievable pp can now be displayed with a skin element.** Select the `MaxPP` attribute for the `BeatmapAttributeText` skin element in the skin editor, and voilà.
- **Player settings have been added to the spectator and replay screens.** This means that you can now adjust the same settings as if you were the one playing.
- **The collection management feature has received updates.** Namely, you can now scroll through your collections, and search for them with the new search bar. Additionally, the game will automatically scroll down to a newly made collection.
