How would you describe the concept or inspirations behind *Operation: Zenithfall*?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Camellia.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31">Camellia</a></p>

"Operation: Zenithfall" was created as the track for the tournament's - OWC2024 - absolute finale. The theme is, very coincidentally, based on the idea of "overturning the top - Zenith", expressing the players' challenges and the drama of turning the tables through music. This track was not only to capture intensity and epicness, but also to deliver a unique experience unlike any other song.

During the brainstorming with concept idea process, I thought, "What if the theme were about carrying out a mission as a member of a secret, covert organization?" By aligning that concept with the players' experience, especially for the attendees/players of the tournament, I decided to incorporate that idea into the music in a curveball way. So I drew inspiration from the iconic sounds of spy films, particularly elements reminiscent of 007. This style of music is rarely heard in the rhythm game scene, so I believe it brings a refreshing and entertaining quality.

As a result, and thanks to other people who did their best jobs to make this song more elaborate than no one ever expected, I believe it became more than just a track, it's a work that combines storytelling and originality. I hope it serves as a new way to conclude the climax of the tournament, and enhance the players' experience.

Players likely remember your last osu! World Cup track *ΩΩPARTS* as the predecessor to hundreds of bespoke songs in osu! tournaments. Do you have thoughts to share regarding its conception?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Camellia.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31">Camellia</a></p>

"ΩΩPARTS" was created as the very first tiebreaker track for the osu! World Cup, and it holds a special place in my heart. This track was not only a first for me but also, as far as I know, the first time osu! had ever tried something like this.

As a concept, I wanted to evoke the sense of an unknown threat, something mysterious and potentially ominous, which I believe the "OOPARTS - Out-of-place-artifacts", like such as the Antikitira Machine or Voynich Manuscript, represents very well. Additionally, since initially I wanted to include this track in the "U.U.F.O." album, I leaned into themes like urban legends, enigmatic ideas, or even simply featuring mysterious objects. These elements naturally shaped the track into what it ultimately became.

I still vividly remember the excitement and honor I felt when the track was actually played as a tiebreaker in the tournament - it was a very intense and exciting moment for me, and hopefully for the most other people watching, or playing, too. It's absolutely honorful to see that people still love the track with passion, and I believe it's genuinely from the magic that the rhythm games have.

What makes me even happier is how this track became the starting point for a tradition of original songs being created for osu! tournaments. The fact that history has been shaped, even in a small way, by something I created is an incredible honor, and I'm proud to have been part of that journey. It's truly amazing to see how far things and other artists' works have come since then, and I'm thankful to have had the chance to contribute to it.

Many of your music releases are considered "boss songs" in a variety of rhythm games. When starting out, what did your relationship with the rhythm game sphere look like, and did you ever envision it as it is today?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Camellia.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31">Camellia</a></p>

When I first became involved with the rhythm game sphere - it was an arcade rhythm game title SOUND VOLTEX by KONAMI - it was simply a way for me to share my music, and share my love and creation. I was already a huge fan of rhythm games as a player, completely obsessed with their fun, but I never imagined that my tracks would someday be regarded as "boss songs" within them.

In the beginning, I focused on creating music that expressed my favorite genres and styles, enjoying the process of seeing how my work would be used in games and received by players.

But over time, I began to embrace the idea of "creating music that enhances the gameplay experience," consciously incorporating intense rhythm parts and challenging elements unique to rhythm games. As a result, I'm incredibly happy that many players have enjoyed my music, and that it's often recognized as "boss songs" as their biggest challenges. I could never have dreamed of becoming as deeply involved with the rhythm game community as I am today, but it has been one of the greatest joys and honors of my career.

Is there a story behind your fedora?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Camellia.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31">Camellia</a></p>

Nowadays, it's not just something I wear on stage - it's become a part of me, completely, like glasses. Thanks to that, many people remember me as "the guy with the fedora", and I really like that! These days, I almost never leave the house without a hat, and honestly, the idea of going out without one is getting a bit scary - like I feel like being naked...

Even people who have never met me in person recognize me by my hairstyle, glasses, and, of course, this fedora, which makes meeting up incredibly easy. It's also not uncommon for people to spot me in real life and ask, "Are you Camellia?". That's insane!

Do you have any general thoughts to share about this project and the people you've been working with?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Camellia.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31">Camellia</a></p>

The people I've been working with are incredibly talented, passionate, and extremely kind to me and everyone. Every time I get to experience their energy and creativity, it inspires me a lot. Additionally, I'm so happy to be back here after four years. Though I've worked with mania, taiko and catch mode tournaments too, seeing people getting happy that I'm back is amazing.

While working on the music, I was able to incorporate their feedback and ideas, which I believe made the final product even better. I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone involved, players participating in the tournament, organizers, staff, and everyone else who contributed. Thanks to all your efforts and support, this project has come to life. It was absolute cinema!

And, by the way, this message will self-destruct in 5 seconds.
