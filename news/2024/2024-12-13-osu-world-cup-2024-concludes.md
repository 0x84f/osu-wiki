The United States and Australia faced off once again in the losers' grand finals, a rematch of their winners' semifinals bout. Two weeks ago, the United States won the match 6–4, but Australia would have something to say about that this time around. This match was a back-and-forth slugfest with the best players on each team finding ways to pop off again and again and again in the hardest pool OWC has ever seen.

Things started off relatively predictably, with Australia banning out [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287847#osu/4881475) and [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287988#osu/4881763), while the USA banned out [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287978#osu/4881745) and [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/20949#osu/74684). What wasn't predictable was that after taking the win on [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287643#osu/4880978) by only 127,583 points, Australia also took a first pick break point on the USA's [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288047#osu/4881933) first pick. Australia would go on to have the top team score of the whole weekend, beating both of the USA's scores and South Korea's score on the map, with ::{ flag=AU }:: [cyo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8195473) top scoring the map with a whopping 950,339 points on hard rock. The USA then managed to break back on Australia's second pick, [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287942#osu/4881677), with ::{ flag=US }:: [hydrogen bomb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7813296) and ::{ flag=US }:: [Utami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7512553) top scoring the lobby, before losing their own second pick in [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288022#osu/4881869), where three of the players for Australia all outscored the top player from the USA.

Australia then went on to, predictably, win their next pick in [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/988552#osu/2067859), with ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) top scoring the map on the weekend with 919,384 points. This all meant that, out of the first five picks in the match, the USA only took one of them, with Australia starting off 4-1 in this match. This was anything but the predicted start, as Australia was expected to have the advantage on speed and higher bpm maps throughout the match, with the USA being better on gimmick and reading overall. Australia had already taken maps like [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288047#osu/4881933) and [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288022#osu/4881869) away, in theory limiting the pick strategy for the USA.

The United States, however, would not be deterred. They went next into [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1116399#osu/2332178) where they won with a 403,555 point lead. Australia continued to pick into speed, but as with [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287942#osu/4881677), this strategy began to falter; [FM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287985#osu/4881760) ended up going the way of the Americans, with ::{ flag=US }:: [WindowLife](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4108547) top scoring the lobby for the second time with 717,002 points. The USA then picked into [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287963#osu/4881714) and won this as well, with ::{ flag=US }:: [WindowLife](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4108547) once more top scoring the lobby alongside ::{ flag=US }:: [tekkito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7075211), their captain.

This resulted in a tied game, 4–4, between the two teams. Despite the USA being the six-time defending champions, Australia would not be deterred. Even having just lost on hidden, they picked next into [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287961#osu/4881712) and managed to win by a slim margin, only 145,259 points. The United States, with the pool heavily whittled down, picked [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287973#osu/4881729) next and also won their pick by a slim margin — this time, only 31,077 points!

The match would finish off with another set of traded points. The Aussies took their [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1392496#osu/2874944) last pick by virtue of their supporting scores being better, while ::{ flag=US }:: [hydrogen bomb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7813296) matched ::{ flag=US }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) and top scored the lobby, and the Americans took their [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287983#osu/4881757) last pick in much the same way, with ::{ flag=US }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) top scoring the lobby with 908,435 points. When the match gets to 6–6, only one map remains; it was time for the tiebreaker!

This last map, however, was not where we would see the peak of OWC dominance finally fall. [Operation: Zenithfall](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287992#osu/4881796) would go to the Americans, with ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) top scoring the lobby once again but ::{ flag=US }:: [Utami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7512553), ::{ flag=US }:: [hydrogen bomb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7813296), and ::{ flag=US }:: [WindowLife](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4108547) all outscoring the second-best score on team Australia. Despite how close this match ended up, with many points traded for both teams with less than a 200,000 score difference, the end result still favoured the reigning champs. For the tenth time in a row, the United States would move on to the Grand Finals to face off against South Korea.

### ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea vs. ::{ flag=US }:: United States

It was uncharted territory for the South Korean OWC roster. Though they'd played in the past two grand finals as the representative from the upper bracket, they had never been the favourites, even with the bracket reset advantage in their back pocket. That honour went to the United States, and with good reason: the USA, after their 2023 triumph, had won eight of the last nine World Cups and were perennial favourites.

2024, though, was different. Coming off their victory in the winners bracket final and playing at a level of historical dominance not seen since the famed 2019 USA roster, South Korea had finally flipped the script: the underdogs had become the favourites, with 67% of pick-em participants choosing them to defeat the six-time defending champions and take home the title of osu! Champions.

Finally, match time arrived, and all discussion and analysis were cast aside as the 2024 OWC Grand Final got under way.

The match began with a strong sense of déjà vu. Just as in the winners final, South Korea banned two tapping maps (this time [FM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287985#osu/4881760) and [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/20949#osu/74684)); just as in the winners final, the United States responded with two gimmick/reading bans with [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288022#osu/4881869) and [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287847#osu/4881475); just as in the winners final, South Korea had the first pick, and just as in the winners final, the USA took a break point on the opening map. In a stunning reversal of fortune from the losers bracket final, not only did the USA win [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288047#osu/4881933) this time, they went on to take a 4–1 map lead, winning their early picks in [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287942#osu/4881677) and [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287978#osu/4881745) before taking a second break point via a 36,223 point victory on HD3.

Collective déjà vu intensified through 5 maps: the day before, Australia had led the United States by an identical 4–1 score; now it was the United States' turn to hold an early advantage as South Korea were forced to search for some way to turn the tide.

And what a turn it would be.

The United States' next pick was the circle size 7.8 [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287973#osu/4881729) pick; led by a 540,581 score from byeok2044, South Korea took their first break point of the match. Next, they decided to stay in the HR pool by picking [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1116399#osu/2332178), where it was ::{ flag=KR }:: [fragranceofpage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11399348)'s turn to lead the way for the Koreans with a 671,622 score en route to a victory. Despite an uncertain moment for South Korea following ::{ flag=KR }:: [byeok2044](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8472976) disconnecting on DT4, ::{ flag=KR }:: [FlyingTuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078)'s 731k score led them to another break point, and suddenly the match was tied. South Korea had stolen two break points from the United States, they had grabbed the momentum, and they would not look back.

[NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287939#osu/4881668) was the next pick for South Korea, where a massive 1841 combo from ::{ flag=KR }:: [byeok2044](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8472976) helped secure them another map and a 5–4 lead in the match. The comeback was in full force, and the tables had unequivocally turned.

The United States opted into [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1392496#osu/2874944), but it was another fruitless endeavour, as ::{ flag=KR }:: [byeok2044](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8472976) continued to display his incredible level of play by top scoring it with a 795,672 play, taking a third straight break point and setting up championship point for South Korea.

Never willing to let the cinematic potential of such a moment go to waste, their selected map was [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287914#osu/4881614), a brutally challenging aim control alt map. South Korea raced to an early advantage and the United States could do nothing but watch their hopes and their dynasty unravel as the map played out: by the time all was said and done, ::{ flag=KR }:: [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450) would be atop the map with a 433,888 score, leading his team to victory on the map and with it the tournament.

South Korea had finally done it. The reign of the United States as osu! World Cup champions had come to an end at their hands, and in remarkable fashion: from being down 4–1, the South Korean squad did not drop a single map the rest of the way, taking 6 straight picks to close the match out 7–4. Their performance throughout the 2024 World Cup was stunning, dropping just 9 maps to the United States in their two matches while going undefeated through the rest of the tournament, all with multiple team members near the top of the performance score leaderboard every week. It was a victory for the ages, one which will be etched in the history of the osu! World Cup for all time.

[FlyingTuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078) was the captain of the winning team of osu! World Cup 2024, South Korea.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/dio.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

South Korea dropped only nine points in total against only one team, making this the second most dominant win of any team in OWC history, statistically speaking. Do you feel that South Korea's performance in matches this year were as dominant as this stat implies?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/FlyingTuna.jpg')"></a>

Yes, I think our performance was outstanding. Honestly, I believe we could have won without giving up many points even against USA, but the pressure of playing against them was much bigger than we expected, which led us to giving them some breakpoints

How much do you consider tryouts when forming the roster as opposed to tournament performance throughout the year? How about the previous year's OWC performance?

Last year, our main focus was on whether we could compete skillsets like speed and mechanics which favor USA when we face them in the later rounds.

However, this year, instead of focusing on skillsets that favor USA, we decided to focus on skillsets that we are good at (like tech, alt, hidden, gimmick) and just give up on speed.

You have [Nopekjk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4585186) listed as an analyst on your team collab, and [Allegrissimo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9052194) shouted him out with smoke writing during the TB showcase. What was his role this year as an analyst and past player for OWC South Korea?

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078">FlyingTuna</a></p>

Yes, Nopekjk was our analyst. Throughout the whole OWC he would analyze the scores that the opponents would get on each map of each stage and would help us with pick and ban whilst also encouraging us and supporting us mentally.

South Korea finished in the top 4 eight times since 2014, top 3 5 times since 2016, and second in 2019, 2022, and 2023. What does it mean for you to finally get the win this year?

To be honest I can't really express my emotions enough with just words. I am so overjoyed and happy that this happened after everything we as a team have been through. This means so much not just to the 2024 roster players but also to past roster players who have been cheering and supporting us throughout all this time. It is definitely one of the greatest things in my life and I will cherish it always.

How would you describe the concept or inspirations behind *Operation: Zenithfall*?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Camellia.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31">Camellia</a></p>

"Operation: Zenithfall" was created as the track for the tournament's - OWC2024 - absolute finale. The theme is, very coincidentally, based on the idea of "overturning the top - Zenith", expressing the players' challenges and the drama of turning the tables through music. This track was not only to capture intensity and epicness, but also to deliver a unique experience unlike any other song.

During the brainstorming with concept idea process, I thought, "What if the theme were about carrying out a mission as a member of a secret, covert organization?" By aligning that concept with the players' experience, especially for the attendees/players of the tournament, I decided to incorporate that idea into the music in a curveball way. So I drew inspiration from the iconic sounds of spy films, particularly elements reminiscent of 007. This style of music is rarely heard in the rhythm game scene, so I believe it brings a refreshing and entertaining quality.

As a result, and thanks to other people who did their best jobs to make this song more elaborate than no one ever expected, I believe it became more than just a track, it's a work that combines storytelling and originality. I hope it serves as a new way to conclude the climax of the tournament, and enhance the players' experience.

Players likely remember your last osu! World Cup track *ΩΩPARTS* as the predecessor to hundreds of bespoke songs in osu! tournaments. Do you have thoughts to share regarding its conception?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Camellia.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31">Camellia</a></p>

"ΩΩPARTS" was created as the very first tiebreaker track for the osu! World Cup, and it holds a special place in my heart. This track was not only a first for me but also, as far as I know, the first time osu! had ever tried something like this.

As a concept, I wanted to evoke the sense of an unknown threat, something mysterious and potentially ominous, which I believe the "OOPARTS - Out-of-place-artifacts", like such as the Antikitira Machine or Voynich Manuscript, represents very well. Additionally, since initially I wanted to include this track in the "U.U.F.O." album, I leaned into themes like urban legends, enigmatic ideas, or even simply featuring mysterious objects. These elements naturally shaped the track into what it ultimately became.

I still vividly remember the excitement and honor I felt when the track was actually played as a tiebreaker in the tournament - it was a very intense and exciting moment for me, and hopefully for the most other people watching, or playing, too. It's absolutely honorful to see that people still love the track with passion, and I believe it's genuinely from the magic that the rhythm games have.

What makes me even happier is how this track became the starting point for a tradition of original songs being created for osu! tournaments. The fact that history has been shaped, even in a small way, by something I created is an incredible honor, and I'm proud to have been part of that journey. It's truly amazing to see how far things and other artists' works have come since then, and I'm thankful to have had the chance to contribute to it.

Many of your music releases are considered "boss songs" in a variety of rhythm games. When starting out, what did your relationship with the rhythm game sphere look like, and did you ever envision it as it is today?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Camellia.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31">Camellia</a></p>

When I first became involved with the rhythm game sphere - it was an arcade rhythm game title SOUND VOLTEX by KONAMI - it was simply a way for me to share my music, and share my love and creation. I was already a huge fan of rhythm games as a player, completely obsessed with their fun, but I never imagined that my tracks would someday be regarded as "boss songs" within them.

In the beginning, I focused on creating music that expressed my favorite genres and styles, enjoying the process of seeing how my work would be used in games and received by players.

But over time, I began to embrace the idea of "creating music that enhances the gameplay experience," consciously incorporating intense rhythm parts and challenging elements unique to rhythm games. As a result, I'm incredibly happy that many players have enjoyed my music, and that it's often recognized as "boss songs" as their biggest challenges. I could never have dreamed of becoming as deeply involved with the rhythm game community as I am today, but it has been one of the greatest joys and honors of my career.

Is there a story behind your fedora?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Camellia.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31">Camellia</a></p>

Nowadays, it's not just something I wear on stage - it's become a part of me, completely, like glasses. Thanks to that, many people remember me as "the guy with the fedora", and I really like that! These days, I almost never leave the house without a hat, and honestly, the idea of going out without one is getting a bit scary - like I feel like being naked...

Even people who have never met me in person recognize me by my hairstyle, glasses, and, of course, this fedora, which makes meeting up incredibly easy. It's also not uncommon for people to spot me in real life and ask, "Are you Camellia?". That's insane!

Do you have any general thoughts to share about this project and the people you've been working with?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Camellia.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31">Camellia</a></p>

The people I've been working with are incredibly talented, passionate, and extremely kind to me and everyone. Every time I get to experience their energy and creativity, it inspires me a lot. Additionally, I'm so happy to be back here after four years. Though I've worked with mania, taiko and catch mode tournaments too, seeing people getting happy that I'm back is amazing.

While working on the music, I was able to incorporate their feedback and ideas, which I believe made the final product even better. I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone involved, players participating in the tournament, organizers, staff, and everyone else who contributed. Thanks to all your efforts and support, this project has come to life. It was absolute cinema!

And, by the way, this message will self-destruct in 5 seconds.
