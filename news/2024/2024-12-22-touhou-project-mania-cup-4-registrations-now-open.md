With the celebration of the Touhou Project's 30th birthday, the Touhou Project Mania Cup is returning with its 4th iteration, bringing tons of improvement in competitiveness and player enjoyment!

The [Touhou Project Mania Cup 4th](/community/forums/topics/2015815), or THMC 4 for short, is a team-based osu!mania 4k tournament. The tournament features 100% Touhou-related music and aims to bring top-tier competition to the tournament scene.

We’ve had 80 teams [last year](/wiki/en/Tournaments/TMC/3rd), with **Bloxy cola** reaching the top with an undefeated performance. [This year](/wiki/en/Tournaments/TMC/4th), with more teams joining the competition, which team will rise to the challenge and become the best? 

## What's new

- **A Group Stage will debut this year** featuring a 16-group format. This means that we will have **64 teams** in the main event.
  - If more than 70 teams play the qualifier, the group stage will use the split double elimination format.
  - If fewer than 70 teams play the qualifier, the group stage will use the standard double elimination format.

![Groups format](/wiki/Tournaments/TMC/4th/image/group-stage-bracket.png)

  - **Each team will have 2 bans in the group stage**, providing extra strategic options throughout the different weeks.
- **The "X" Picks will apply for RC and LN slots**, giving players more options to pick harder charts.
- Two teams from each group will advance, with a total of 32 teams competing in a standard double-elimination bracket for the championship.

## Custom charts 

With almost **50 custom mappers** featured, this year we are bringing you a **nearly full custom** mappool from beginner to high-end. We hope this will not only enhance our Touhou journey but also contribute to the osu! community by adding more Touhou maps!

You can check out [Supa7onyz](/beatmaps/artists/435)'s brilliant Grand Finals custom tiebreaker songs from last year as an example!
