Want a taste of open rank without the absolute powerhouses taking the whole spotlight? Are you a 3 digit player, just barely not able to make it on the OWC team because your country is just too stacked? For viewers and players alike, the 3 Digit World Cup is back for its 7th iteration in 2025!

The **3 Digit World Cup** (*pending forum url*), or 3WC for short, has been a mainstay of the community world cups since 2019, eventually molding it into the hyped event that loads of players look forward to at the start of the year. This year is no exception, with older staff and players looking to upkeep the expected competitiveness and quality that the tournament has provided over the years, as well as newer accolades putting their name out there for people to keep track of during the year, and maybe even prove themselves in the main world cup and other international tournaments.

Despite the 3 digit range (#100–999) being very restrictive, it's the perfect stage to watch players who might sometimes get overshadowed by the hypercarries of their country in the osu! World Cup, or smaller teams benefitting from the reduced team size. The combination of matches being 3-on-3, a maximum of 6 players per team, and pool difficulty right behind the apex of tournament play always generates a very competitive tournament, and while waiting for the 2025 iteration to start, you can revisit all previous matches starting from 2021 on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@3wc_osu).

## How do I register?

To register, simply head over to the **registration page** (*pending url*) to connect your osu! and Discord accounts. Players who sign up via the aforementioned link and meet the following criteria will be eligible to participate:

- **Your osu! global rank must be within #100–999 at the time of registrations closing** (January 12, 23:59 UTC)
- **You must not have violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**

All countries with at least 3 eligible registrants will have one player designated as the captain by the organisers. The captain is then responsible for selecting and submitting a roster of 3–6 players to represent their country in the tournament. Countries with more than 6 candidates are encouraged to host tryouts for their team to aid in selecting the best players.

Joining the official [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ZjPs7ya) of 3WC is mandatory for all players selected on a team, but we still encourage everyone, even spectators, to join in order to keep up with all important announcements and tournament livestream notifications. Be sure to also check out the forum thread (*pending url*) or the wiki article (*pending url*) for more information and rules. We hope to see you all join in — be it by playing or spectating!
