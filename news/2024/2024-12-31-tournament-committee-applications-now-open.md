If you want to lift the tournament community to new heights, apply to join osu!'s Tournament Committee today!

The [Tournament Committee (TC)](/wiki/People/Tournament_Committee/en.md) is seeking new members and invites anyone with tournament experience to apply in our first application cycle, including players!

While you may read all of the team's details in the link above, the primary responsibilities of TC members are as follows:

* Engage in the tournament review process, including approving / denying badge support for tournaments and communicating requested changes to hosts.
* Evaluate tournament reports and process user inquiries.
* Maintain the [Official support](/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support/en.md) page.
* Guide members of the tournament community towards making better decisions.

As a member of the Tournament Committee, you must meet these requirements:

* **You must be at least 18 years old.** This is not negotiable. The content which is viewed by TC is often not suitable for those under the age of 18.
* **You must not have any recent account infringements.** Users who have faced action by the osu! team within the last 12 months are not eligible to join the team.
* **You must have multiple years of osu! tournament activity.** As a TC member, it is expected that you are on the top of your game when it comes to tournament knowledge. You should be able to guide newer community members and function as a leader of the tournament scene. As such, it is expected that you have at least **2 years** of tournament-related involvement of any kind.
* **You must be fluent in English.** Nearly all of the content we review & communications we deliver are in English.

Additionally, you are expected to have the following qualities:

* **Maturity and professionalism.** TC members must display a certain level of professionalism when interacting with other members and the community at large while participating in official duties.
* **Level-headedness and critical thinking.** The situations the team deals with are commonly multi-faceted and require thorough analysis. Jumping to conclusions is not something we want to see.
* **Good behaviour.** Users joining the group are expected to have a history of good behaviour within the community and tournaments they are involved in.

Finally, here are some standout qualities we are looking for in candidates:

* Clear understanding of hosting process and badging criteria.
* For staff members, having hosted multiple badged tournaments is a plus.
* For staff members, having a history as a tournament player is a plus.
* For players, having staffed multiple tournaments or having hosted one or more badged tournaments is a plus.

Users who are accepted will be contacted for a single 20-minute interview with 2 random active TC members for further evaluation. This interview is functionally a conversation and opportunity for us to get to know you better - so don't be nervous! Anyone participating in an interview is invited to pick our brains so you can learn more about the team, workload, or anything else. Please note that this interview will be recorded and shared with the rest of the team.

So, what are you waiting for? **[Click here to apply!](https://www.google.com/)** After authentication, you will be able to fill a Google Forms questionnaire which collects some basic information before presenting scenario-based questions. Please set aside around 30 minutes to complete this application - the more thorough your answers, the better!

This application will remain open for !N! weeks, closing on !DATE!. It may take us quite a long time to process all of the applications, so please be patient. We hope to process all applications within 6 weeks after the closing date.
