The community's beloved keysmashing tournament is back for another year! With a record breaking number of 228 registrations and the very first time the bracket begins at Round of 32, the tournament's ambitions have grown ever so larger — the largest they've ever been!

This year, the mappooling team has opted to slightly modify the mappool format. With the introduction of a new long note category, and a new-found focus on testing players in a wide variety of skillsets, we have gotten but a small glimpse into the future of this year's pools to come.

With the introduction out of the way, let us get into the nitty-gritty of this year's Qualifiers pool! Stay tuned, as later on we'll get to chat with several members from the mappooling team.

If you're new to the series, fret not! [SurfChu85](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4469895) and [yukina meng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9919550) got you covered with the mappool's basics.

Players were given a warm welcome into the tournament with a fairly standard-sized 8 stage Qualifiers pool. But size isn't what matters for all intents and purposes. From changing the LN release picks to be LN coordination, to introducing one of the most intense hybrid maps to date in a Qualifiers pool. And while the core of the pool remains the same, those teams who were able to adapt to the changes were able to gain an edge over their peers!

Speaking of highlights, let's talk about the star of the pool: [aran - Yoake Mae feat. shully](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2303945#mania/4924806) (LN1) by [_Kobii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6209713) ::{ flag=MY }::. Whereas in previous years this would've been a long note pick with a focus on releases, this time around the poolers decided to test players' finger coordination as a whole. Other noteworthy maps include [Mono - skip&step](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2115949#mania/4443569) (RC3) by [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092) ::{ flag=US }::, a fun and varied rice experience meant to keep players on their toes — or shall we say, their fingers? Finally, we have [seatrus - Hekikuu no Yakusoku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2303946#mania/4924807) (HB2) by [Critical_Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196) ::{ flag=MY }::. Players got a little of tiebreakers to come, as well as the intensity they should expect.

But we've only just begun, and future mappools are yet to be revealed. Who knows what surprises have the poolers been preparing for us? To wrap things up, have a small fun fact! This mappool was *almost* fully comprised of licensed tracks, with seven of its eight maps using songs from the [featured artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

Players and spectators alike only get to experience the results of the mappooling team's hard work. But more often than not, they're unaware of the process nor of the challenges that come with it. Keeping up with players' expectations is no easy feat afterall. Therefore, we'd like to have a chat with three members of the pooling team. Each responsible of one piece of the puzzle. As such, let us introduce [_Kobii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6209713), [ExNeko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7590894), and [cheewee10](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4477497) to lecture us on the herculean task of pooling for MWC 7K!

## The weight of being the head pooler must be nothing short of burdensome. How does one manage to meet the community's expectations? What are the challenges that come with such an endeavour?

While the workload is nothing to scoff at, it is an honor to be appointed as the head pooler for one of the osu! World Cup tournaments! Being a head pooler and an advisor comes with a lot of doubts and uncertainties, as well as expectations to withstand. Thankfully, after years of experience in mappooling I've managed to understand and address what needs to be improved, addressing past issues. And while not perfect, I couldn't be more satisfied with the result!

Mappooling isn't as easy as some might think. It's not just a matter of selecting appropriate maps, but rather creating a custom pool to meet everyone's expectations. Preparation is key, and the mappooling team has been working non-stop from as early as June 2024 to ensure the quality of the pool is up to par for a tournament of this magnitude. 

With a team as varied and talented as ours, there are bound to be conflicting opinions. Occasionally leading to lengthy discussions. Ultimately, a conclusion had to be reached by finding a compromise between the mappoolers and the mappers. Additionally, given the size of our pools we sometimes had to make do with insufficient feedback from playtesters. Suffice to say, pooling for a tournament of this size is a stressful task. And while it's my responsibility to adhere to the deadlines, we've learned that none of us want to work under a time crunch—period.

## What are the challenges that mappers face when pooling for tournaments? Are the restrictions imposed by the needs of the pool too big of a challenge to overcome? How these issues impact your original vision of the maps?

## How would you describe your experience as a playtester, after having been on the other side of the fence for so long? Is balancing the pool as easy of a task as some players' opinions may lead to believe?
