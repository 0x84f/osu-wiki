New year, new osu!(lazer) updates.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-01-19-osulazer-updates-january-19-2025/banner.jpg)

The grind never stops at osu!HQ, and while the highly anticipated osu!(lazer) iOS release is still not ready for the public, there are other things cooking up, along with a major multiplayer change dubbed "freestyle" coming very soon to a device near you!

### Editor changes

- **The editor now displays storyboards.** You can now gaze at your works in their entirety.

- **Separate audio and background files can be selected for each difficulty.** While separate backgrounds per difficulty already existed in osu!(stable), separate audio files previously had to be assigned by manually changing the `.osu` file. Going forward, this can be done in osu!(lazer) with no hassle at all.

- **Bookmarks have been added.** Finally, bookmarks.

- **The beat snap divisor is now changed with `ctrl` + scroll.** Previously `ctrl` + `shift` + scroll, the bindings are changed to match osu!(stable).
- **The metronome can now be sped up when pressing `ctrl`.** The speed change will depend on the chosen snap divisor.

- **You can now override combo colours.** *[Colourhaxing](wiki/Beatmapping/Colourhaxing)* has been made way more convenient, with a GUI element allowing you to select any colour you want for any hit circle, and automatically resuming the colour rotation from the last selected colour.

- **Playback speed is now automatically reset to 100% when entering test play.** Unfortunately this means that for the time being there's no way to change the playback speed at all.
- **New combo is now forced on objects after a break.** A small quality of life change preventing weird issues such as followpoints appearing during breaks.

### Gameplay changes

- **Relax mod hit leniency is now identical across osu!(stable) and osu!(lazer).** If you ever noticed that the Relax mod hits circles more accurately on osu!(lazer), that behaviour is now a thing of the past.
- **The pause cooldown has been removed in the intro and break time.** Generally the pause cooldown serves a purpose, but it was deemed not necessary during non-gameplay sections of maps.
- **Per-beatmap calibration data for the audio offset is now saved even if you exit the map.** This was broken in one of the previous updates, and has now been properly fixed.

### Skinning changes

- **New `SkinnableModDisplay` element has been added.** This element shows all active mods, and while it doesn't replace the already existing mod display, it can have its own uses.
- **You can now rename your skins.** A rename button has been added for any currently selected skin, so now you can get rid of all the `(Modified)` suffixes added to all the skins that were changed in the skin editor.

### Other changes

- **Multiplayer auto-start can now be set to 10 seconds.** This update goes out to all of "those" friends who refuse to ready up in the lobby.

</div>

- **Multiplayer rooms can be filtered by their status.** The room listing will now show whether a room is already playing a map, and those rooms can be filtered out.
- **Friend leaderboard scores are now highlighted yellow.** A small feature that's been missed by many.
- **Notifications for friends going online/offline have been added.** This makes stalking your friends on osu!(lazer) much easier!

- **The recommended difficulty value is now visible in the in-game beatmap listing.** Previously only available on the osu! website, this value is now displayed in-game as well, allowing you what star rating osu! thinks you should play.
- **Maps can now be marked as played in song select.** Previously named `Removed from unplayed` the `options` menu in song select, this button now actually works, and has been renamed to `Mark as played`.
- **Extensions are now better handled in order to support side-by-side osu!(stable) and osu!(lazer) installs.** This means that within Windows you can specify which version of the game should open when opening osu! related files, as well as select default apps for extensions of the aforementioned files. There are still things to polish out, but this is a major step forward.
