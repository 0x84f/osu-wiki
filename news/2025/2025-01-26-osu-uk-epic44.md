osu! UK at EPIC44

The UK community's biggest LAN meetup is back in the calendar!

From the humble beginnings in August 2016 at Insomnia Festival, there has always been a big get-together at least once a year in the UK, growing to over 100 attendees in 2019. Sadly, with the announcement that Insomnia isn't returning, the community has had to look elsewhere.

In steps EPIC - a 4-day esports-focused LAN within which the UK community has found its new home, and on top of the meetup the event also facilitates a 2-day single-elimination tournament for BYOC attendees with Finals held on stage, right alongside other large esports titles!

Check out Spazza's vlog of the event to get a glimpse of some of the fun to be had: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0s9Or3voC0&t=5s

The event is located in Leisure Arena Kettering and next runs from 20-23rd February, with the osu! tournament qualifiers taking place between 12:00 and 22:00 on Friday 21st. The top 16 qualify to play a single-elimination bracket the next day, and duke it out for the chance to battle it out on-stage, potentially winning hundreds of Great British Pounds and a lovely profile badge.
