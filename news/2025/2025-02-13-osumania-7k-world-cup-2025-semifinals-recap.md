As teams begin shifting to their top gears, the tournament's zenith looms ever closer! The last remaining 7K titans clash head-on with bone-chilling performances all across the bracket.

If last week was this tournament's low point, then this week was the complete opposite! Only legends remain, and the chances for any team's success grow slimmer by the day. Those who thought things couldn't get harder from now on, were proven to be sorely mistaken. Only for Finals and Grand Finals to be bound to break the skill ceiling once again to an unimaginable degree.

There have been quite a lot of exciting moments on this week alone. From historical feats achieved by some of the teams, to fun moments shared amongst the pooling team members. Tournaments are meant to be fun after all, both to its participants and organisers!

We even got the chance to interview ::{ flag=PE }:: [-luvv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23731514) on behalf of team Peru given their players' performances throughout the tournament. Definitely a story worth telling from one of this year's most promising teams!

Rambling and spoilers aside, this week's video recap is yet again brought to you by [SurfChu85](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4469895) and [yukina meng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9919550). A very good alternative to the usual podcasts you may be used to listening in the background on your spare time.

| **Indonesia** ::{ flag=ID }:: | **6** | 1 | ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation |
| BIG MAXUS | 6 | **7** | **ET BLOCKO** |
| **Malaysia** ::{ flag=MY }:: | **6** | -1 | ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile |
| United States ::{ flag=US }:: | 2 | **6** | ::{ flag=PE }:: **Peru** |

| **Hong Kong** ::{ flag=HK }:: | **6** | 0 | ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany |
| Hong Kong ::{ flag=HK }:: | 2 | **6** | ::{ flag=PE }:: **Peru** |

This week was nothing short of amazing! We reached a point of the tournament where the best of the best teams are being tested against one another. The matches between ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea versus ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan and ::{ flag=CN }:: China versus ::{ flag=PH }:: the Philippines should get the point across, with all four teams being the top 4 seeded teams on this year's Qualifiers!

The last two teams standing in the winners' bracket are ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea and ::{ flag=CN }:: China, who'll be facing each other in the Finals to see who gets to keep their spot in the Grand Finals. The rest of teams however haven't had it as easily in the losers' bracket given how high the stakes were.

On the other side of the bracket, teams had to win two consecutive matches to keep up with the pace. ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia and ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru were able to survive the gauntlet, moving on to the Finals for their very last chance at redemption. A very exciting moment for Indonesian fans, who get to see their country get to the Finals for the first time since all the way back to 2017!

And what other way to begin with the match highlights than by recapping the best of the best show match this series has ever seen. Truly a fight between an unstoppable force against an immovable object!
