With one week to go till this year's MWC 7K ends, teams have started to get ready for the final sprint. Everything up until last week may've been just a jog for some, but it's soon to become one final mad dash to the top of the podium!

We're reaching a point where finding highlights is getting harder and harder. What is there to highlight if everything is worthy of it? All the teams still standing have fought tooth and nail to be with us today. So let us wait no longer and dig deep into last week's happenings.

Before that though, given China's performance across the tournament, we decided to host a short interview with the team's captain, [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904). A fitting person nonetheless, given their amazing scores throughout the tournament's span! Hard to see a week go by without topping the scoreboards.

With the handy help of [SurfChu85](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4469895), [yukina meng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9919550), and [Nerfox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7976724) we've managed to get these recaps done in video form — this week was no exception!

## Semifinals summary

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| **Japan** ::{ flag=JP }:: | **7** | 0 | ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru |
| **Philippines** ::{ flag=PH }:: | **7** | 0 | ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia |
| **Philippines** ::{ flag=PH }:: | **7** | 6 | ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan |
| **South Korea** ::{ flag=KR }:: | **7** | 2 | ::{ flag=CN }:: China |

Following last week's trends, with only the best of the best teams remaining, these matches were not short of amazing either. Regardless of a match results, the level of play shown in last week's skirmishes was unmatched to any other week. The pool's (almost) final bump in difficulty didn't make things any easier for the players.

With South Korea being the sole victor of the winners' bracket, they currently have the most advantage over their rivals. With the Philippines surviving losers' bracket after their win against Indonesia and their **very** narrow victory over Japan, they'll get to rematch China in Grand Finals. That's a match we'd suggest bearing witnessing to given the very heated rivalry between China and the Philippines!

We can't stress enough how all of this week's matches were worth watching. While we would suggest watching them all, we'd like to highlight what has possibly been the most exciting match not only of the week but of the tournament as a whole!

Here we go, folks! This is a match you can't miss, no matter what.

The Philippines previously won in 2023, breaking South Korea's winning streak, and they�re now looking to secure a spot on the podium once again. Japan, on the other hand, has always been a powerhouse, especially in the rice department, where they�ve defeated some of the strongest competitors. Yet, they�ve never reached the grand finals podium, making this a high-stakes match for them.

The match started predictably, with Japan protecting RC3 and banning EX2, while the Philippines protected LN4 and banned RC1. Both teams capitalized on their strengths and covered their weaknesses to the fullest. However, a major upset occurred right away when Japan picked EBIMAYO - NIGHTMARE INVITATION (RC2). At first glance, this seemed like an obvious choice, as it�s one of Japan�s strongest skillsets. But the unexpected happened when Rainlily made uncharacteristic mistakes throughout the play, allowing the Philippines to win the match by 22,449 points and immediately set the breakpoint for the first match.

The intensity ramped up when the Philippines picked Marmalade Butcher - CuttingEdgeInsaneArtifact (LN3). Both teams engaged in a close back-and-forth battle, with Japan having multiple opportunities to take the lead. However, several critical misses at the end of the map sealed the victory for the Philippines, who won their pick with a 5,472-point difference.

Japan faced a moment of nervousness after losing their first rice pick. They decided to switch things up by selecting Walpiso Corter - Oxalis (Cut Ver.) (RC6) and having Suzuha_l play the rice pick instead of Rainlily. This strategy paid off, as Japan finally secured their first point convincingly, with Butanic achieving an impressive score of 988,493 and a magnificent ratio, slowly closing the gap.

The Philippines, however, weren�t about to let their advantage slip. They continued to focus on hybrid or long-note picks, while Japan accumulated points through rice picks. Both teams exhausted their protect picks, with Japan choosing Kohta Imafuku - Last Fireworks (RC3) and the Philippines opting for KOTOKO - Agony (LN4) to maintain their lead. This kept the match at 4-2 in favor of the Philippines.

The battle unexpectedly tightened again with Japan�s tech pick, Kolaa - async (RC4). The map�s volatile patterns caused constant full-board misses for both teams, resulting in a tight score margin throughout. Japan ultimately won this round with an 11,803-point lead. A similar trend followed with the Philippines� pick, Yooh - Divinity (Short Ver.) (LN3), where Ojisan�s extraordinary full combo score of 982,737 sealed the victory.

Japan finally got their chance when the Philippines picked lapix - Horizon Blue feat. Kanata.N (HB2), a tech hybrid map known for its tricky minijacks and shields that can easily trip up players. The match became incredibly intense as both teams constantly shifted momentum with razor-thin margins. Japan secured the breakpoint at the very end with a 1,425-point lead, tying the match at 5-5.

This was a critical moment for both teams, with the possibility of a tiebreaker looming. Japan picked their last available rice map, Akiri - Blocko ET (feat. Jinjin) (RC5), and secured their match point with Butanic hitting an impressive score of 989,460. The Philippines, with two maps left, chose Aoi - Welkius (EX3), a harder hybrid map requiring immense physicality and consistency. Their strategy worked brilliantly, as they won their last match point convincingly, triggering the tiebreaker that would decide which team advanced to the grand finals.

At first glance, the Philippines seemed to have the advantage in the tiebreaker, as EX3 maps are known for their challenging patterns and difficulty. However, Japan proved everyone wrong by keeping the match intensely close and even maintaining a lead for a significant portion of the tiebreaker. The critical moment came in the final section of the chart, where the Philippines managed to close the gap to a hair�s breadth. Just when it seemed Japan would pull ahead with a 5,000-point lead, the Philippines made a stunning comeback during the last long-note section, securing victory by a mere 101 points. This shocking turn of events left the audience and commentators in disbelief.

You can see the reaction to that final moment in the video below:

This was undoubtedly one of the most intense and hyped matches in the entire 7K World Cup history. Both teams fought fiercely until the very end, with the outcome remaining unpredictable and full of major upsets. Congratulations to the Philippines for advancing to the grand finals, and a huge round of applause to Japan for delivering an unforgettable match that will go down in mania tournament history. Despite their narrow loss, Japan�s team remains a powerhouse, and we�re excited to see how they�ll improve in the next 7K World Cup!

Interview intro

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14128407" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/[GB]yobrevelc.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14128407">[GB]yobrevelc</a></p>

Congratulations on getting to the top 3 for the first time since 2022! How does the team feel about the possibility of taking revenge on the Philippines? You guys will have to face them again in the Grand Finals, so what are the expectations for this upcoming match?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/tyrcs.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904">tyrcs</a></p>

Last year, our match against the Philippines ended in a heartbreaking comeback loss, which was truly regrettable. Therefore, when they chased back 2 points in a row after we were leading 5:2 and reached match point, all of us were quite nervous. Fortunately, we managed to end that match before it reached the tiebreaker. The mappool for the Grand Finals is considerably much more challenging compared with the Semifinals. I hope that under the pressure of such a mappool, everyone can demonstrate their normal skills and deliver a match that more exciting than Semifinals.

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14128407">[GB]yobrevelc</a></p>

Given this year's mappool compared to previous years — with the changes to LN1 and EX picks — how have these changes influenced your team's matches? Have you guys benefitted from it?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/tyrcs.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904">tyrcs</a></p>

Actually, the switch from Release to Inverse for LN1 didn't affect us too much. It might be beneficial for players who are skilled at Inverse and rarely touched tournament maps. But in our team, those LN specialists are all experienced in tournament. They have been able to transfer their experience from the old LN1 to the new LN1 effectively. Although the EX category is a new concept this year, there have been maps with similar roles in past mappools (such as Minerva in MWC7k2023 Grand Finals RC5). Overall, the experience of the mappool hasn't been changed by the newly introduced EX category significantly from previous years.

It is pleasant to see that the Chinese roster included both experienced and newer players. As a captain, how will the team be arranged in the future? Any advice for up-and-coming 7K players?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/tyrcs.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904">tyrcs</a></p>

Currently, the base of Chinese 7k player is full of fresh blood, many players have shown their promising future. Starting from 2025, team China has started to use tryout for selection. If a new player with better skill passes the tryout in the future, they can join the team and have fun in MWC. Since the patterns in touranment maps are considerably different from those in most ranked maps, players planned to participate in MWC might consider looking beyond ranked maps, playing more tournament maps to improve their stability and accuracy, and to strengthen their weak points.
