The last purge before Grand Finals has finished. With only three teams remaining, let us see how we got up to this point!

With one week to go till this year's MWC 7K ends, teams have started to get ready for the final sprint. Everything up until last week may've been just a jog for some, but it's soon to become one final mad dash to the top of the podium!

We're reaching a point where finding highlights is getting harder and harder. What is there to highlight if everything is worthy of it? All the teams still standing have fought tooth and nail to be with us today. So let us wait no longer and dig deep into last week's happenings.

Before that though, given China's performance across the tournament, we decided to host a short interview with the team's captain, [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904). A fitting person nonetheless, given their amazing scores throughout the tournament's span! Hard to see a week go by without topping the scoreboards.

With the handy help of [SurfChu85](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4469895), [yukina meng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9919550), and [Nerfox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7976724) we've managed to get these recaps done in video form — this week was no exception!

## Semifinals summary

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| **Japan** ::{ flag=JP }:: | **7** | 0 | ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru |
| **Philippines** ::{ flag=PH }:: | **7** | 0 | ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia |
| **Philippines** ::{ flag=PH }:: | **7** | 6 | ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan |
| **South Korea** ::{ flag=KR }:: | **7** | 2 | ::{ flag=CN }:: China |

Following last week's trends, with only the best of the best teams remaining, these matches were not short of amazing either. Regardless of a match results, the level of play shown in last week's skirmishes was unmatched to any other week. The pool's (almost) final bump in difficulty didn't make things any easier for the players.

With South Korea being the sole victor of the winners' bracket, they currently have the most advantage over their rivals. With the Philippines surviving losers' bracket after their win against Indonesia and their **very** narrow victory over Japan, they'll get to rematch China in Grand Finals. That's a match we'd suggest bearing witnessing to given the very heated rivalry between China and the Philippines!

We can't stress enough how all of this week's matches were worth watching. While we would suggest watching them all, we'd like to highlight what has possibly been the most exciting match not only of the week but of the tournament as a whole!

Given this year's mappool compared to previous years — with the changes to LN1 and EX picks — how have these changes influenced your team's matches? Have you guys benefitted from it?

It is pleasant to see that the Chinese roster included both experienced and newer players. As a captain, how will the team be arranged in the future? Any advice for up-and-coming 7K players?
