These are not "clans", they're not "subdivisions", nor are they "guilds" — they are **teams**! And they're here to stay.

It's time for a [15-year-old feature request](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/29780) to see reality. This feature which was once requested by [[Sean]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/202721) exactly 14 years, 9 months and 10 days ago, ended up amassing a total priority of **+11.744** over the years. An idea which was widely supported by the community up to this day has finally come into fruition!

Despite how many years have passed since the inception of the idea, the core goals of the feature remain the same: to grow and nurture osu!'s many, scattered sub-communities. Users can find new ways to engage with other like-minded members with many of the new features to come. We always knew this was a community game, but this feature will make this aspect ever so slightly more prevalent!

## What's new

The [last osu!(lazer) update](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-02-20-osulazer-updates-february-20-2025) introduced a new "Teams" feature. This is a new way for the community to express shared interests and proudly display groups they are part of.

Teams are shown besides usernames in places like user profiles, leaderboards, and forums. Each team gets a flag and name to display everywhere, a unique acronym to go along with it, a banner and description, and their own internal leaderboard.

Users can interact with all of these features by going to the ["My Team"](https://osu.ppy.sh/teams) page at any time. Players not yet in a team will be given the option to create one. Alternatively, by going to the page of an existing team, users will be able to apply to any team they see fit!

### Features

While the feature is still in its infancy, there are plenty of things users can already do with teams:

- Create and join other users' teams.
- Manage incoming applications.
- Compete with your peers in the team's leaderboard.
- Proudly display your allegiance with a team flag and unique acronym!

You can expect to see more features in the future as the system is refined, such as displaying team leaderboards in osu!(lazer) or team versus team matches.

### Limitations

Despite the many features already introduced from the get-go, there are still some limitations to keep in mind:

- Team acronyms are unique.
- Both team acronyms and names are permanent.
- Team leaders cannot be swapped.
- The maximum team size is dependent on the amount of [osu!supporters](/wiki/osu!supporter) on the team.
  - Each supporter will add 4 slots to the base team size of 8, up to a cap of 256.
- Currently, the web does not dispose of a listing with all available teams in the platform.
  - This also applies to the [osu!api (v2)](https://osu.ppy.sh/docs/index.html) which does not have an endpoint for teams.

Some of these limitations may be lifted as the system is iterated upon, a lot of which may depend on the community's feedback. Don't be afraid to propose and discuss changes in the [osu!web GitHub repository](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues?q=is:issue%20state:open%20teams%20label:area:team)!

In the meantime, if team leaders wish to change their team's name, acronym, or even the leader itself, they may do so by contacting the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team) via [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh).

## Stats

It's hard to put into perspective how much the community has grown to love teams ever since their release despite their recency. So why not put it into numbers instead! [MegaMix](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711) has taken the time to compile an [unofficial team list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z0ddlo3EudoNJdEssrm3tMQYOQY7YQEdXWhMN7JV2TM?rm=minimal).

Here are some of the most noteworthy stats:

- Around **6780~ teams** were made during the first 7 days. Close to 1000 teams per day!
- Currently, only one team has reached the maximum team size of **256 members**, that being [yuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/teams/14) with a team ID of 14.
- Nearly **1650~ teams** only have their creators as members. Show these users some love by joining their teams!

While in the developers' own words this is not meant to be a complex system, its addition will add an extra layer of interaction between community members. So, what are you waiting for? Gather your buddies up and create your own team today!
