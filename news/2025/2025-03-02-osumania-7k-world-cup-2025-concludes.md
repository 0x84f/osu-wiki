![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-02-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-concludes/banner.jpg)

What an amazing year this was! Not only did we get to experience a new take on the 7K World Cup with the plethora of changes that have been made to the format and production value of the series, but we may have got to witness the most exciting tournament to date. From new teams becoming legends overnight, to old rivalries clashing once (or twice) again this year.

While we have tons to cover for the Grand Finals recap, let's take a quick break to congratulate this year's champions, shall we?

## Summary

![MWC 7K 2025 podium](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K/img/mwc7k2025-podium.jpg)

Congratulations to ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea for winning 2025's first official World Cup! With this win, South Korea has amassed a total of **13 total osu!mania World Cups** under their belt between 4K and 7K, with a total of 8 being in 7K. A feat easier said that done!

While South Korea's dominance over 7K is not news to anyone, it's easy to understand the Herculean effort that has gone behind such an accomplishment. This year's teams were no joke. Competition only ever got fiercer with the increase in the bracket size. And despite the extra hurdles, South Korea remains as the undisputed champions of 2025! We'd like to extend our deepest congratulations to the team for their well deserved victory.

For those who'd wish to skip to this week's highlights, we've got you covered [down below](#grand-finals-recap)!

![Grand Finals mappool table](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-02-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-concludes/mappool.jpg)

Grand Finals mappools have always been notorious for their difficulty. And this one is no exception! In fact, the trend from past years shows that it's becoming increasingly more difficult to play with every passing year. This paradigm shift forced teams to play outside their comfort zones, who had to play while pushing their very limits.

We had a couple returning [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music#official-tournament-releases) such as [DJ Raisei - T.R.A.P.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325366#mania/4984357) (EX1) made by [aci](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9650304) and originally featured in the [osu! World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2022), and [TWC Sound Team "Xurv Stasis Rasufim" - Kaze no Denwa (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325116#mania/4983795) (RC5) mapped by [pwhk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4887865) and first seen in the [osu!taiko World Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024). What no one was expecting was that the round would feature only one new track — little did we know quality would far surpass quantity!

Speaking of EX1, that was one of this week's standouts! [aci](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9650304)'s MWC 7K debut comes with an absolutely nightmarish map. Those familiar with aci's work know how extreme their maps can be, making this a perfect fit for the slot. The relentless nature of the map forced players to perform at their best, as even the smallest mistakes can be very costly.

The second map highlight-worthy was [Raimukun - Nyarlathotep's Dreamland](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325126#mania/4983819) (LN2) by [Enie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11976455), who was able to perfectly capture a new style of LN Density by featuring a lot longer long notes. To no one's surprise, this map posed a considerable challenge for the players — understandably so! The map is really dense after all. Despite the dense patterning, the chart also incorporates a generous amount of comfortable patterns, which somewhat offsets the difficulty brought on by its density.

But what about the new track that was teased a couple paragraphs ago? Fret not, for we wanted to give it the attention it deserves, alongside its artist who will be joining us as a Featured Artist moving forward. Drum roll, please!

This week's big surprise was actually twofold! Not only did we get to witness an amazing **9 minutes** long track and tiebreaker beatmap to go along with it, but also we got the announcement that its artist, [Ludicin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/459), will be joining osu!'s [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) moving on!

[Lost Requiem](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325151#mania/4983858) can be briefly described as this tournament's magnum opus. Mapped by [_Kobii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6209713), [_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750), [Critical_Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196), [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092), [ruka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6117525), [ExNeko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7590894), [U1d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10125072), and even [Ludicin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8659666) themselves, this relentless marathon is a direct result of all creative minds in the team being put into use! This was not only an affair between the artist and the mappers, with multiple teams collaborating to bring into life one of osu!'s most ambitious commissions yet. So, why not take a look at the map itself?

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmccFHPScKA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The graphics team worked overtime with this one. Not only was the map accompanied by a groundbreaking storyboard by the hands of [RiceSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271436) and [binarie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15632854), but also a showcase video worthy of admiration produced by [CrewK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604) and [TheFunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13981991) with the trusty help of [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024). If that wasn't enough, [KM](https://twitter.com/KM2650223087343) and [Zeth](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966) with their beautiful illustrations and graphics respectively put the cherry on top of an already impressive cake.

Suffice to say, the team is very proud of the work. Seeing the community's breathtaking reaction put everyone at ease. We can confidently say their efforts did not go to waste, and this map alone is a testament to the team's dedication for the tournament!

## Grand Finals recap

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| **China** ::{ flag=CN }:: | **7** | 5 | ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines |
| **All-stars Red** | **7** | 6 | All-stars Blue |
| **South Korea** ::{ flag=KR }:: | **7** | 0 | ::{ flag=CN }:: China |

All good things must come to an end. And this World Cup is no exception. That said, this year's grand finale hasn't left us short of surprises! Not only did we get to witness this year's winning match between South Korea and China, but also the conclusion of the Philippines' and their nemesis throughout the tournament — that being China. We even got to witness a show match between one of osu!mania's best sets of 7K players to date!

Suffice to say, there's a lot to go over despite the reduced number of matches. We also got a set of [interviews](#interviews) prepared to gain some insight from the creative team involved in this week's osu! original showcase plus an interview with South Korea as this year's winners. Don't miss out on these!

And how could we forget the amazing video recap by the hands of [SurfChu85](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4469895), [yukina meng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9919550), and [Nerfox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7976724) who have been working overtime throughout the last couple of months to churn out these amazing, easily digestible recaps.

Without further ado, let's get into last week's match highlight. And contrary to what you may be expecting, this wasn't the match to decide the victors but rather its runner-up!

### ::{ flag=CN }:: China vs. ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines

Coming in hot from their Semifinals match, China and the Philippines face off once again after China's initial 6–4 score. This made it possible for China to achieve their first Grand Finals appearance since 2022! However, the Philippines camer back stronger than before after their hard-fought victory against Japan, seeking revenge for their previous loss. In turn, this made for one of the most intense and nerve-wracking matches of Grand Finals — let alone the entire tournament!

Unsurprisingly, both teams stuck to their original strategies. While China opted to focus on the rice pool by protecting [DJ Raisei - T.R.A.P.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325366#mania/4984357) (EX1) and banning [Ludicin - Signal](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325160#mania/4983871) (HB2). Meanwhile, the Philippines protected [Aoi - excez](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325127#mania/4983820) (LN1) and banned [BilliumMoto - 100 Carat Smoke Point](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325114#mania/4983791) (RC4). This proved to be a successful strategy for China, whose first pick was their protect, winning it by a landslide and a 73,986-point lead.

The Philippines quickly responded by picking [Raimukun - Nyarlathotep's Dreamland](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325126#mania/4983819) (LN2). China adjusted by switching players to ::{ flag=CN }:: [[Crz]Satori](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7082178) and ::{ flag=CN }:: [VanWilder](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/89545) to counter the long note-heavy chart. The Philippines held their ground, however. Thanks to ::{ flag=PH }:: [Ojisan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405)'s as the MVP of the match and their impressive 978,133 score, the Philippines comfortably got their first win.

This initial back-and-forth was an omen of what was to come, with each team dominating their respective picks. During this skirmish, there were some notable moments such as the Philippine's choice of [rejection - Aimai Attitude (feat. Nakamura Sanso)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325129#mania/4983823) (LN3) and [Aoi - excez](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325127#mania/4983820) (LN1) which were promptly won by them, or the Chinese rice counter-attack with [Junk - Aihana](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325135#mania/4983834) (RC3), allowing ::{ flag=CN }:: [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904) to excel with a full combo 983,858 score.

Both teams traded blow up until the scoreboard hit the 5–5 mark. A critical point for the both teams! China stayed true to their strategy and picked [Super Psychic Fujy - Dark Avatara Beam (Le Dos-on Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325303#mania/4984227) (RC2). Much to everyone's surprise, this resulted in a much narrower score gap than anticipated. With ::{ flag=PH }:: [Ojisan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405)'s flawless performance, with a 987,636 point score, the Philippines got incredibly close to winning! Much to their dismay however, China won the pick by a relatively slim margin of 8,704 points, squeezing the very last points they could on the map's ending.

With the scoreboard being at 6–5 in China's favour, the Philippines had to make a tough choice: [MisomyL - Coming*True!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325139#mania/4983838) (HB1) or [Genesis - Absolute Evil](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325148#mania/4983851) (EX3). They ultimately chose the former, a reasonable choice due to its easier patterns and lower physical demands which benefited their team. The Philippines started strong, taking an early lead, but with ::{ flag=PH }:: [sanni666](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3036686) and ::{ flag=PH }:: [Ojisan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405)'s unfortunate misses, China was allowed to regain their footing. Despite a flurry of misses coming from both sides in the final stretch of the map, the Philippines' mistakes proved very costly, and China claimed the last victory they needed with a 2,786-point lead, denying the Philippines' final chance to come back and denying them the win.

Both teams delivered a performance worthy of admiration, making the match very thrilling and unpredictable up until the very end. Congratulations to China, who were now able to face off against South Korea in the very final match of the tournament! The Philippines also deserves our utmost praise for their efforts, making every match they were in very entertaining to watch. We hope to see them return even stronger in the future to reclaim the 7K World Cup Champions title that they once held!

## Score highlights

Some of the scores we saw throughout the Grand Finals weekend put the cherry on the top of what has already been a very special MWC 7K cake. It's really hard to pick individual scores from such performant players, however. In light of this, we've decided to highlight one player from each team to spotlight their best performing scores!

- Of the many charts ::{ flag=PH }:: [Ojisan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405) has played last weekend, including the show match, their performance on [rejection - Aimai Attitude (feat. Nakamura Sanso)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325129#mania/4983823) (LN3) (980k) and [MisomyL - Coming*True!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325139#mania/4983838) (HB1) (972k) were mesmerizing.
- With our jaws wide open from before, we now have space to put in ::{ flag=CN }:: [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904)'s sublime runs on [Himeringo - Kodoku no Kakurenbo (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325113#mania/4983786) (RC1) (974k) and [Nanahoshi Kangengakudan feat. Hatsune Miku - No.39](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325120#mania/4983811) (RC6) (968k) in our mouths.
- Rounding out our carbohydrate-rich osu!mania 7K diet, ::{ flag=KR }:: [yz1155](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2071008) barged in with plenty more spoonfuls of rice with their impressive scores on [BilliumMoto - 100 Carat Smoke Point](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325114#mania/4983791) (RC4) (966k) and [DJ Raisei - T.R.A.P.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325366#mania/4984357) (EX1) (954k).

That said, we want to call back some of the most impressive scores we witnessed throughout the tournament! Even in earlier rounds, we got to witness some of the best performances of the entire tournament.

- ::{ flag=CN }:: [af-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10512663) and ::{ flag=PH }:: [sanni666](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3036686) surprised everyone in [Round of 32](/news/2025/2025-01-24-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-round-of-32-recap.md) with their 991+k scores in [Neko Hacker - Shadows feat. Such](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2307450#mania/4934981) (LN1). These scores in the LN inverse category were *arguably* one of the best ones in the category throughout the entire tournament!
- And why were the previous scores *arguably* the best? Well, that's because the crown of the jewel had to be ::{ flag=JP }:: [butanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586)'s run during [Round of 16](/news/2025/2025-01-31-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-round-of-16-recap.md) on [Phoenix Legend - She Xiang Fu Ren (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2310775#mania/4943407) (LN1) with its 994,000+ full combo score, rivaling even the best of scores in other categories!
- Last but not least, ::{ flag=KR }:: [dessurf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406) technical prowess was showcased on [The Flashbulb - Six Acid Strings](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2318102#mania/4964713) (RC4) during the [Semifinals](/news/2025/2025-02-13-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-semifinals-recap.md) with an amazing score of 991k.

It's worth mentioning that highlighting the best of the best scores is no easy task. If it were by us, all scores would need to be highlighted!

## osu! originals

It is very easy to underestimate the effort being put into the commissioning process behind every single brand-new track. And yet despite all odds, this year's 7K World Cup has given us **7** new [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music#official-tournament-releases) for the osu! community to enjoy! This year was able to boast of a wide variety of genres. Moreover, artists previously uninvolved with commissions such as [Marmalade butcher](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220) have taken their chance to debut in this year's tournament!

Hopefully the interviews we had throughout the last couple of months gave everyone a glimpse into the tournament's inner workings. None of this would've been possible without the [team](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K#organisation) who arranged the tournament, the [players](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K#participants) who gave their all, and you — the community who supported both throughout the tournament's runtime!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-02-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-concludes/mwc7k2025-credits.png)

We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone involved into making this possible. And for as much as it pains us to say it, we'll have to tune out till next year! But fret not, as the World Cups will go on. The osu!taiko World Cup 2025 is right around the corner, so make sure to keep an eye out for it!

But in case we don't see you... Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night! Or something like that.
