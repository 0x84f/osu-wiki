Once upon a time, **WEARY** produced his first piece of music. Half a decade later, he landed in our Featured Artist library!

Latvian musician **hikota** is a master of mood-setting. Mixing inspiration from video game soundtracks with a specialty in atmospheric drum & bass, jungle, and occassional vocaloid thrown into the mix, **hikota**'s unique combination of skills lends to a one-of-a-kind bass-oriented listen.

[**hikota**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/462) has a grand total of **15** tracks, each timed in advance for your next session in the editor.

Need some inspiration? [nik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10077264) and [Kyouren](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2013571) have you covered:
