With a total of **78** entrants, this iteration has been a whirlwind of creativity and color, hence why we're equipping each and every one of you with **15** votes to decide the champions of this magical showdown.

This time, there has been a distinct lack of dotted osu! cookies in the submissions, and we want to thank you for that (except for the one person who submitted the template itself as an entry. You will be hearing from our lawyers soon).

- A selection of the top-voted finalists will be **featured on the main menu**.
- Top-voted entries will receive **3 months of osu!supporter**.
- The top 3 will receive bespoke **profile badges** made from their own creations.
- The top 3 will also be featured as [**limited-time default profile banners**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-15-aerial-antics-art-results#new-profile-customisations), with the ones from last round rotating out.

As always, thanks to all participants who've dedicated their time and effort into creating and submitting an entry — without you, we wouldn't be here!

That's all for now, GLHF!
