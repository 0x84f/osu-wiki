![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-04-02-3-digit-world-cup-2025-concludes/conclusion-banner.jpg)

2025 was a big year for 3WC: with an ever higher production quality and multiple original songs, the tournament keeps pushing the boundaries and raising the bar it has set for itself. Over the past few months, fierce competition has raged on in what is one of the greatest showcases of talent within rank-restricted tournaments.

## Summary

![](/wiki/Tournaments/3WC/2025/img/podium.jpg)

Congratulations to ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea for their third title in a row, the ::{ flag=US }:: United States for showing up to an intense and unforgettable Grand Finals match, and ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany for their first-ever podium finish in 3WC.

Coming into the tournament, it was inevitable what the top 2 would look like; but no one could have predicted exactly which way it would swing. The tug of war between these two behemoths was closer than it has ever been, with both teams going neck and neck throughout, from Qualifiers all the way to the very last pick of the tournament, the bracket reset tiebreaker, culminating in what was hands down the best that the 3 Digit World Cup has ever been.

Read on for a detailed summary of the Grand Finals and [other close matches further below](#match-highlights).

Those who followed 3WC closely throughout this year's iteration expected a close grand final. The United States and South Korea were the obvious top two teams this year throughout, and while the U.S. won their matchup in the winners' final 7–4, it seemed inevitable that they would contest a closely-fought Grand Final.

Imagine the surprise, then, when the opening set was anything but competitive. South Korea came out on a rampage, winning four points in a row before finishing off the set by a dominant 7–1 scoreline. The United States looked lost in a way that no U.S. country roster had looked in years. Everything they tried failed, regardless of skillset; whether they picked reading, tapping, tech, or aim, South Korea had the answers. Meanwhile, the Koreans were at the top of their game on their own picks, not even coming close to dropping a single break point on their way to forcing a decisive bracket reset match.

The saving grace would be that the teams agreed to a week long delay before that bracket reset would be played. The United States had seven days to go back to the drawing board, to reset their strategies, to practice their picks, to adjust their bans, to do whatever they possibly could to avoid an ignominious defeat at the hands of their fiercest rivals in the scene. South Korea, meanwhile, would be forced to sit on their hands, waiting out a delay that would slow the momentum they had gained in the first set.

As soon as the bracket reset got under way, it became clear that the United States had put their time to good use. They changed both of their bans, swapped their early picks, and adjusted their map rosters; meanwhile, South Korea played to their strengths, early picking maps they had won in the first set and stealing a break point on the [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1703903#osu/3481594) pick, led by a full combo from ::{ flag=KR }:: [fragranceofpage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11399348). The United States wouldn't go away easily, though, and stole a break point back on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1848926#osu/3798091), with ::{ flag=US }:: [tekkito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7075211) joining the roster for this map and putting up 599,950 score to top the lobby and carry them to a victory.

From that point on, the teams fought back and forth, neither giving an inch with a seemingly inevitable outcome in the offing. The United States earned the single match point either team would hold, taking a 6–5 lead with a win on [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2036791#osu/4280072) off of ::{ flag=US }:: [BoshyMan741](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4830687)'s full combo with the Easy mod, but South Korea answered with the performance of a lifetime on [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/181957#osu/1151879). They showed why the U.S. were wise to ban it in the first set, as ::{ flag=KR }:: [Allegrissimo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9052194) and ::{ flag=KR }:: [fragranceofpage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11399348) went absolutely thermonuclear, putting up scores of 908,852 and 825,614, respectively, to force the ultimate moment of any tournament: a grand finals bracket reset [tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2337098#osu/5017830) — one map for ultimate glory. And who else could it be to step up in this key moment than ::{ flag=KR }:: [fragranceofpage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11399348)? The top performer of the entire tournament would be the key to victory, putting together a massive 1637 combo en route to a 416,009 score, soundly the highest in the lobby, to lead South Korea to victory in the map and with it to claim their third straight 3WC victory.

### Finals: ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany vs. ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom

</div>

Germany and the United Kingdom faced off in the losers bracket of the Finals stage for their last chance to guarantee a spot in the top 4. The United Kingdom were until this point making a strong push through the losers bracket after a loss to the Unites States in Quarterfinals, whereas Germany were fresh off a tough loss the previous week to the top seed in South Korea.

Germany started off strong, taking a break point on the United Kingdom's first pick of [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2332976#osu/5006403), before scoring a dominant win on their own pick of [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2205966#osu/4670486). Down by two points, the UK fought back with a strong score of 370,362 from ::{ flag=GB }:: [skiatzo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16774872) to take a point on [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2333230#osu/5006948). As both teams settled into the match, they would continue to trade points. Each team found decisive wins on their own picks, with standout performances including ::{ flag=DE }:: [Fleh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7780605)'s 828,773 HR choke on [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1257525#osu/3036752) and ::{ flag=GB }:: [HAUNTE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7333471)'s 631,174 HR score on [FM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1492550#osu/3169730).

Down 4–3, the United Kingdom finally had a chance to get their break point back on [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1276352#osu/2789103). ::{ flag=DE }:: [criller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8116659) and ::{ flag=GB }:: [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050) dominated the pick for their own sides with scores of 897,607 and 958,166 respectively, but despite the latter winning the 1v1 standoff, Germany managed an overall slightly better team performance, winning the map by 65,087 points. This would signal a turning point in the match as each pick from here on out would develop into a closely fought battle. After winning [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1569794#osu/3205628) decisively, the United Kingdom wouldn't miss their second chance at a break point as they stole [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2062538#osu/4314556) from the hands of Germany by 90,934 points.

With the mappool quickly shrinking down, the United Kingdom hedged their bets on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2074570#osu/4342484), where in an incredibly close pick, Germany came back at the very end to secure the map by 29,184 points. Now on match point, Germany opted into the pure aim [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/878167#osu/1836680) for their last pick, and held on by 118,259 points to win the match 7–5 and secure themselves the spot in the top 4.

### Finals: ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland vs. ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

</div>

With the podium looming over the remaining teams, it seemed like all of them were out for blood. With the United Kingdom's shocking exit the day before, a lot of questions were being asked about the match between Poland and the Philippines, and whether it would amount to the same level.

And they would not disappoint. Poland would be down two players for the match, giving the Philippines a massive opportunity to contest on picks that a full Polish roster may have handily taken home. Despite the disadvantage, Poland opened the match strong, led by a 750,508 score from ::{ flag=PL }:: [Tartis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9513980) on [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1276352#osu/2789103) to put themselves on the board 1–0. Both teams would then keep capitalising on their strengths, until the Philippines would slip up at 3–2 on their [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2333309#osu/5007132) pick, where a gigantic score of 618,379 from ::{ flag=PL }:: [Kosiarek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9086565) singlehandedly ensured the break point for Poland.

Looking to carry through with the sudden burst in momentum and to consolidate the break point, Poland would choose [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1884924#osu/3880952) as the next battleground. With an overall better team performance to secure the point, Poland was now in a commanding 5–2 lead and the match was starting to look bleak for the Philippines. Not distraught by the deficit, the Philippines would opt for what worked before, trying their luck on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2074570#osu/4342484). Both teams started brilliantly, and the closely fought battle would keep going as neither side was ready to give an inch, until finally a full reset from Poland allowed the uncontested combos from ::{ flag=PH }:: [NathanRam1918](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4734703) and ::{ flag=PH }:: [Icarussy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19526828) to secure the pick for the Philippines.

Not wanting to be outdone, Poland would return to tapping with a win on [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1257525#osu/3036752), putting themselves at match point with four chances to close out the match. Now cornered and with Poland breathing down their neck, the Philippines pick [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2205966#osu/4670486) as their first gambit. With a full combo from ::{ flag=PH }:: [LordGabriel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9227895) and nearly another from ::{ flag=PH }:: [zonelouise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1492995), they would take the point with an enormous score lead of over 1 million.

With one pick remaining for each team, Poland, now eager to end it on their own, would keep the tapping train running with [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1617731). The pick went on as close as it could have, with all six players holding over a thousand combo halfway through, until a double break from the Philippines gave Poland a huge opportunity to run away with the match. But the door would not stay open for long, with a full reset from Poland now putting the fate in the hands of ::{ flag=PH }:: [LordGabriel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9227895)'s full combo. But as with everything in this pick, the advantage would be short lived, resulting in neither team having the edge with no combos on the board. The Philippines would eventually hold the slightest lead for the rest of the map, surviving by a mere 11,473 points by the end.

Now heading into the last pick of the match, the Philippines had only one map in mind. The precision-testing [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2062538#osu/4314556) was the obvious choice after winning the other Hard Rock picks previously. After some back and forth following a strong start from both teams, it looked like Poland was able to stabilise themselves. But as the map was ramping down, the misses began raining from the sky for Poland, and by the skin of their teeth, by 3,370 points, the Philippines bring the match to tiebreaker. After taking a break during HR3, ::{ flag=PH }:: [NathanRam1918](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4734703) would enter back into the lobby and show everyone what the Philippines are made of with a gigantic 1,511 combo, leading the team to victory with a final score of 592,094, finishing off the comeback of the tournament.

[EthantrixV3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10634348) (a.k.a. EthantrixV2) has been on the rise for the past year or so, joining the United States in this year's 3WC for a second place finish.

How would you describe yourself to someone less involved in the tournament scene?

HELLO!!! I am EthantrixV3.

I've been a tournament player for a few years, but only recently started breaking into mainstream tournaments for my scores on Hidden or gimmickier maps. Anything else you'll probably catch me twiddlin my fingers on the bench (SOON TO CHANGE!).

You might also know me from my many and significant contributions to music (such as [I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2109207#osu/4427155) and Criller Night).

Despite falling short of the 4WC team last year, you earned a spot in 3WC and managed multiple standout performances throughout the tournament. Was this improvement something you were anticipating?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10634348" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/EthantrixV3.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10634348">EthantrixV3</a></p>

Every time I got benched from a roster last year I used it as fuel to improve — not even for my own sake; I just wanted to make anybody who thought I wasn't good enough to be put on the team look like a fool. My good old friend, buddy washingtonian pal [conradmittn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8208289) said once that the USA hatefarmed me into becoming a threat after being put on the back burner for 4WC, EZWC, and OWC in 2024. Without those rejections, I think I'd be far from the player I am now.

And listen... I ain't mean to toot my own horn... But just between you and me and everyone in the world reading this: I shoulda been on in 4WC... AND EZWC... AAAAAAAAAAAND OWC!

You'll never see me on the bench again... GET USED TO IT!!!

After losing the first Grand Finals set 7–1, how did your team recover and adjust over the following week to bring it back all the way to tiebreaker in the bracket reset?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10634348" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/EthantrixV3.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10634348">EthantrixV3</a></p>

Our first set crumbled because our team just had an extremely unfortunate set of circumstances. I know [Tekkito "The Ice Cream Man" Michael](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7075211) couldn't practice or play too hot because he came down with a flu for the week. On top of that, we were all generally just not feeling it that day. We never said it, but I think we all realized "well this just ain't gonna be it" pretty early on into the match.

I remember saying after the match that if we were going to lose, that was probably the best way to do it. There was no disappointment about losing a hair away, the opponent thinks we're more cheeks at the mappool than we actually were, and we come in next week with a fresh slate. In the second match, I remember watching our team get our first point on DT1 and thinking that "at the very least we can't do worse than last match". That sort of mindset really made it so I didn't shake much for the match.

Even if we didn't win the match, I'm extremely proud of how our team bounced back to 6–7. It gives me a lotta hope for OWC later this year (WHICH I WILL BE ON!!! GUARANTEED!).

How does it feel like nearly making it to the top of the podium with one of the best United States performances against South Korea in recent 3WC history, all in your first-ever world cup?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10634348" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/EthantrixV3.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10634348">EthantrixV3</a></p>

NOT GONNA LIE! COMING UP ONLY A COUPLA BREAKS SHORT FROM WINNING KINDA SUCKS!!! But DAMN!!! Am I proud and happy to be able to make a deep run with the bros... If I had to choose my favorite team to lose with this has got to be top 3. I hope all of our players stick around because I had a lot of fun playing. Staying up late with [Pezz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10651106) and [Flameztear](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13207763) every week playing the maps in multi was a hoot, even if we didn't like some of the maps.

The fact that it was my first ever world cup didn't faze me much in match. After coming heartbreakingly close to a few tournament wins over the past couple of years, I don't fear losing anymore. When I played in that second match, I wasn't thinking about doing better than any player on South Korea. The only thing I had my eyes on was collecting as many points as possible.

The podium didn't surprise me too much honestly. I knew our team was going to make it to Grand Finals from the beginning. The drive (AND SKILL!) the whole way through was insane. Every time we booted into a map in multi, emotions and tears of joy started coming out just from looking at our collab. I don't really change my profile picture from default ever, but this team DESERVED a change. There was only a handful of teams that could've taken us down. But the way you phrased your question WOW!!! THAT DOES SOUND REALLY REALLY COOL!

Do you have any tips or words of encouragement to other up-and-coming tournament players?

I think 1v1 tournaments (or other formats that force you to constantly be in) are AWESOME for pushing tournament improvement, even if you don't make it far. I love team tournaments, but being forced to swap skillsets on a dime, and being responsible for your own scores is something I don't get to experience with a team. I also found that practicing and being responsible for your picking strategy also builds tournament sense fast. Knowing when to pick maps, what scores you can get, when to lock in on certain patterns, etc.

Controlling tournament nerves is something you can only grow by just playing more tournaments. I found thinking about outperforming my opponent in the map was something that only added to my nerves, however. I tell myself in map once in a while if I catch my mind wandering to only focus on my own game and putting up points, rather than doing better than the opponent.

Sometimes I see people who show interest in tournaments but don't play them for some reason. Maybe they think they can't compete with the deranker boogeymen, or they won't join a tournament until they're good enough at some skillset. I think these sorts of reasons focus more on solely winning a tournament rather than for the experience and growth that comes from failing tournaments. If you're at all interested in tournaments I say: MAKE THE JUMP AT LEAST ONCE!!!

Also be nice to poolers (and all tournament staff), they do good work!

I was so excited when I saw the Grand Finals match go to tiebreaker! Seeing my original songs being played in general is a great feeling and especially for the custom songs I made for 3WC, I really felt like all my effort paid off and it really gave me a feeling of accomplishment with how far I've gone as an artist/musician. Thank you to the viewers for all the kind words on my originals this year for 3WC!

While you started producing originals for osu!mania tournaments at first, and VSRGs are your main rhythm game experience, you have also dipped your toes in the osu! mode recently via works in [Bingsu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2011772?n=1), [Resurrection Cup 2024](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Tournaments/RESC/2024), and now 3 Digit World Cup 2025. Does anything in your workflow change depending on the gamemode?

I feel like there is a nuanced difference between my originals for standard compared to those for mania in terms of my thought process when making the song. Personally for standard originals, I really focus more on active rhythm parts compared to mania originals. Usually, I will also need a lot of help from hosts/mappers whenever I make certain slots for standard tournaments since I'm not as familiar with them, which was the case for my Bingsu! custom.

Behind the songs and beatmaps that people see, there are loads of work from other people who usually don't get as much recognition. Is there anyone you'd like to shout out for helping you in the creation of some of the first originals that I've also had the pleasure working with?

Huge shoutout to [SPEC](https://www.instagram.com/its_spec), [OsuMe65](https://osume65.crd.co), and [Kappa_San](https://x.com/Kappa_San0623) for helping me make the background for *Zyphorath Quixalune* and *AZENINE* respectively. Another huge HUGE shoutout to [Bazuso](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11726139), [9ami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1499997), and [oTwinkle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15095654) for mapping cinema. I also want to give a shoutout to [SiLiS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/434) for the collaboration on *AZENINE* being a day one homie. I probably wouldn't be here without their involvement and I'm forever grateful. Lastly, outside of 3WC, I want to also give a shoutout to [Phreel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12840110) for being the first tournament host to give me an opportunity to create osu! originals.

Thank you! I'm really glad that people enjoy it! As for an official world cup appearance, it's a dream of mine to one day be featured in the osu! World Cups and I hope that one day I can check it off my bucket list! peppy-senpai, please notice me!

[JackPaX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11226645) was a star performer of the Greek team and an avid mappool playtester following their elimination from the bracket.

Reaching heights such as the 5th best overall peformer in Qualifiers, and making the majority of the replays for the Finals and Grand Finals mappool showcases, how would you describe the experience of playing for a smaller country in a world cup? Does the smaller scale of the tournament help in any way?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11226645" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/JackPaX.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11226645">JackPaX</a></p>

Playing for a smaller country in a world cup is definitely a one of a kind experience that not many top players get to face. While it has its certain drawbacks of player shortages, early knockouts, and more often than not controversy over minor mishaps, I cannot deny the fact that it can be much more enjoyable than your average tournament experience. It's certainly unique in a way, mostly because the goals are significantly different. Unlike other tournaments where my goals might include winning matches or the whole prize, simply achieving a qualification into the bracket stage or earning a point during the remainder of the tournament can be an extraordinary success.

Another thing that stems from the smaller playerbase that countries like Greece have is the tightly knit community. Be it friend or foe, everyone knows each other and these aforementioned successes get amplified a lot more in the psyche of past, present, and future players, leading to more positive and memorable moments than what some mid-level countries might have.

The smaller scale definitely helps a lot. Where most countries could comfortably field 3 or 4 strong players in a 4v4 world cup, a country like Greece doesn't have that privilege, meaning that one less player who's uncomfortable with the sheer difficulty of the maps being forced to play is a massive bonus. Despite that, even with the 3v3 format, we commonly had issues finding a serious contender for the competition in our 3rd slot for most picks. In short: the smaller the format the better for countries like Greece.

Do you think the existence of something like the 3 Digit World Cup helps motivate these lesser known countries that have one or two star players to try and improve, and eventually show up in the osu! World Cup as well? This year being Greece's very first appearance in 3WC, alongside your rise to the top with really good performances in community team tournaments, definitely makes it feel like this is the case!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11226645" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/JackPaX.jpg')"></a>

For sure! Although as I mentioned before, the 4v4 format of the osu! World Cup ends up damaging our chances a considerable amount as opposed to its 3 digit counterpart. The biggest obstacle for the most part is the mental block that most players face as they are taking a very big step up from their usual competition, making them very anxious and afraid that they will mess up. I feel like once that barrier has passed, and a country can have a group of core players that are not dazzled by the task at hand, then they will definitely be a force to be reckoned with.

After your performance in the 3 stages Greece participated in, the callup to playtesting was inevitable, and as mentioned before, you were one of the most active playtesters. What goes through your mind when you look and play through a mappool that's work in progress as someone more focused on the playing side of the game?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11226645" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/JackPaX.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11226645">JackPaX</a></p>

Many people have varying thoughts about what a "good" or a "fun" mappool can be. Despite that fact, often times when I playtest a work in progress mappool, I have to put myself in the players' shoes. This means I often have to consider that what could be enjoyable and look amazing in my eyes might not be the case for other players. It's for this reason that I have to ask myself: "would a team like to play this alongside me?", "should a beatmap that functions like this be included in this context?", etc., before I proceed with voicing my complaints over a certain pick.

That being said, it's important in my opinion to always voice your own thoughts in certain cases. If I heavily disagree with a specific pick being used, I should make it my priority after testing it to make it known to the hosts/mappoolers in order for it to be considered for swapping. Not being well versed in the mapping aspect of the game but more so the playing side also helps me empathize with the participating players more, however, sometimes we all make mistakes and I might have a miscalculation over the difficulty of some maps due to that. To conclude, I feel that playtesting is just as important as mappooling itself but communication is always key, and having multiple testplayers could considerably help with quality assurance.
