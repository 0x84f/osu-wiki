## General information and rules

### Contest format

- **o!bwc** follows a round-based format, consisting of a **qualifier round** and multiple **clash rounds**.
- **Qualifier round:**
  - The qualifier round is ranking-based.
  - If there are multiple teams from one country registered, only the team that ranks the highest will pass the qualifier round even if they are ranked within the first 16 places. In this case, the qualification will be passed to lower-ranked teams of countries that have not seen a qualified team above.
  - After the qualifier round, the seeding of the Round of 16 matches will be decided according to the ranking of each team in the qualifying round.
- **Clash rounds:**
  - Clash rounds consist of tight-time head-to-head matches between two teams, and only one of the teams will proceed into the next round.
  - Clash rounds are single elimination.

### Country and team

- o!bwc is a team-based beatmapping contest.
- Each team consists of 4–6 members, with one member as the captain of the team.
- The captain is responsible for organising and managing their team and progress as well as communicating with the hosts.
- All team members must share the same country flag.

### Beatmapping

- This contest is for the osu! mode only.
- Along with your submission, you must declare the contribution of your team member. For example, a list of sections mapped by each individual mapper in your team. As this is a team-based contest, members that lack contribution may be excluded from awards and prizes and disqualified from the contest.
- Your submission must be an `.osz` file exported from the osu! in-game editor.
- You must submit at the designated submission site (available once submission is open).
- Your submission should comply with the ranking criteria when applicable.
- Your submission should not contain information that reveals the identity of your team.
- Do not upload or share your submission with others beyond your team before the results announcement.
- You are allowed to use custom hitsounds and custom combo colours. However, you are not allowed to add backgrounds, videos, or storyboards.
- Do not modify metadata such as Artist, Title and Tags in the provided template.

## Judging

- It is mandatory for judges to give comments and reasons behind their judging.
- Submissions are anonymous to judges.
- There will be two panels of judges, one for the *qualifier round*, and the other for the *clash rounds*.

### Judging criteria

#### Qualifier round

- **Expertise (45%)** – How well the map reflects the music elements, with an emphasis on music reflection, pattern/rhythm consistency, coherence, and playability.
- **Creativity (45%)** – How the map stands out compared to current mapping trends and other submissions. Generic maps or copy-paste concepts are discouraged. Creativity built on top of solid expertise is more than important as well.
- **Judge's Impression (10%)** – Judges can award or deduct points based on specific noteworthy aspects as they deem appropriate, such as outstanding sections and hitsounds or vice versa.
- Judging scores will be standardized.

#### Clash rounds

- *Clash rounds* are voting based. Each round consists of head-to-head matchups between two teams.
- Each judge has one vote for each matchup and they must vote for one team out of the two. The team with highest number of votes will pass this round and the other will be eliminated.

## Song selection

- The songs and templates to map will be announced at the beginning of each round.

## Prizes and awards

- Contest points: Elite Mapper Points may be awarded after the contest has concluded (pending approval).
- Badges: Badges may be awarded after the contest has concluded (pending approval).
- osu!supporter and cash prizes: osu!supporter and cash prizes may be awarded to the top teams after the contest has concluded. Availability depends on the sponsorship secured.
