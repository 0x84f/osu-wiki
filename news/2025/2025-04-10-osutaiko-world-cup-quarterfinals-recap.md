Switching things up to a Best of 13 format, the Quarterfinals had some very close matches for some teams. Interestingly enough: Every time the tiebreaker was played, the lower seeded team came out as the victor. Not all of them were able to pull through and come out on top however, so the following teams were unfortunately eliminated in the Quarterfinals: ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines, ::{ flag=CH }:: Switzerland, ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong, ::{ flag=VN }:: Vietnam, ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland, ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada, ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia, ::{ flag=NL }:: Netherlands, ::{ flag=FI }:: Finland, ::{ flag=SK }:: Slovakia, ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia & ::{ flag=NZ }:: New Zealand.

Wrapping up this train of tiebreaker upsets, we have perhaps the most surprising of the week: Team Australia (#8) vs. Team France (#19)—not only the largest difference in seeding, but with Team France holding a total of zero pick’em votes, truly nobody saw this coming.

Australia began by playing it safe with [Marmalade Butcher - =/=Virtual Futural](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347292#taiko/5048649) (NM1), taking their first point while testing the waters. However, France quickly showed that Australia might have gone fishing in the wrong lake, with a hundred-thousand-point win on [Yunosuke - Ziqqurat (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347287#taiko/5048627) (NM6).

Having stirred the pot, the two teams began trading points: Australia winning [Mono. - skip&step](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2069452#taiko/4330009) (HR1), France taking [Hoshimachi Suisei - BIBBIDIBA(AL-1S & UZQueen's Edit)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2207301#taiko/4673960) (NM2), followed by an Australian accuracy advantage on [DARK_GENE - GREEN MAMMALS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347276#taiko/5048593) (FM1), and an extremely narrow five-thousand-point French victory on [Pmarusama. - Tokimeki Broker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2189313#taiko/4630501) (DT2).

While they remained tied at this point, Australia proved their dominance in reading skill with back-to-back wins on [yuha - Nou#m7 (feat. KAFU)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2190945#taiko/4634009) (HD2) and [AQUASINE - you wouldn’t download a bird.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347271#taiko/5048585) (NM4)... but France did the same on the more finicky [Caravan Palace - City Cook](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2147535#taiko/4523594) (DT1) and [Schwank - BPM](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347031#taiko/5047553) (FM2)! At this point, the counting connoisseurs among the viewers knew it was time for yet another tiebreaker.

[Supire - Dead Aire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347284#taiko/5048624) rolled in to raise the tension, and despite an incredible Hidden performance from ::{ flag=AU }:: Jaye, Team France proved to be the bigger fish. Three sets of scores over nine-hundred-thousand bringing them a well-deserved victory.

One of the most anticipated matches of the entire weekend was none other than the winners bracket clash between Team United States (#3) and Team Chile (#6). With 88.5% of the pick’em vote, viewers were convinced that Team United States had the upper hand in this close match up, perhaps not expecting that another tiebreaker was on its way!

Everything started smoothly with Team United States experimenting on the new slot of the pool, picking [Yunosuke - Ziqqurat (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347287#taiko/5048627) (NM6), showcasing a strong three way full-combo and convincing win. Chile responded with [Schwank - BPM](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347031#taiko/5047553) (FM2) on the opposite side of the pool, displaying their mod prowess with a victory on the triple HDHR.

This trend was short lived as Team Chile won a breakpoint on [Hoshimachi Suisei - BIBBIDIBA(AL-1S & UZQUEEN’s Edit)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2207301#taiko/4673960) (NM2) with Team United States immediately winning it back on [yuha - Nou#m7 (feat. KAFU)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2190945#taiko/4634009) (HD2). However, Team Chile managed to keep the momentum in their favour as they took another breakpoint on [Umeboshi Chazuke - Lollipop*driveR](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347262#taiko/5048575) (NM3) and winning their own pick of [reallerr - a funk that never stops](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347270#taiko/5048584) (HD1).

Team United States did not let this ruin their morale as they output three incredible performances in a row on [CBR - Love Maker!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347267#taiko/5048581) (NM5), Team Chile’s [AQUASINE - you wouldn’t download a bird.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347271#taiko/5048585) (NM4) pick, and [Caravan Palace - City Cook](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2147535#taiko/4523594) (DT1), bringing them to the highly crucial match point. With only a few options left, Team Chile took their chances on [+TEK - starlove](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2213428#taiko/4689756) (HR2) and denied Team United States the easy way out with a fifth point of their own, forcing the match into the tiebreaker!

Once again, [Supire - Dead Aire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347284#taiko/5048624) (TB) descended onto the stage where two players on each team took their chances by playing with Hidden. Team Chile managed to secure an early lead and never let it go, narrowly securing their place in the Semifinals winners bracket and upsetting Team United States by 36,748 points.
