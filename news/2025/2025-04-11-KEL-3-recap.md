After the tournament's qualifiers concluded in December of last year, [21 different players](https://liquipedia.net/osu/KEL/3#Participants) (in addition to 11 invitees) got their chance to play against 11 top players that were invited to the event, all in a live setting, with a crowd of people!

All of this culminated in an exciting weekend in Gdańsk, Poland, where from Feb 8th-Feb 9th the community gathered, met their favourite players and content creators, and got the chance to witness top-tier gameplay live in the Kinguin Esports Lounge!

## Day 1

The tournament officially kicked off on Saturday 8th at 12:00 UTC with Round of 32, however players showed up early to get familiar with the space, get their gear set up, and prepare for the upcoming matches. The players were all situated in separate LAN rooms where anyone could walk in while they were warming up, but could also be closed off in order to allow players to concentrate on their matches.

While all that was happening, the production staff were getting ready to start the first stream of the weekend. Various camera setups for the audience and LAN rooms, the main stage audio and video, and the entire stream setup was getting final touches after yesterday's preparations.

While major preparation already took place yesterday, there were issues here and there that kept cropping up, so the staff were on their feet the entire day making sure that all the players got a fair chance at playing without any technical difficulties, and that the stream ran smoothly.

Once everything was set up, the stream was started, and the Round of 32 commenced without any... major issues.

The goal for the first day was to have all matches between Round of 32 and Quarterfinals played out, which required immense effort on all sides to achieve. As for the matches themselves, the first part of the tournament was unremarkable in terms of matches, as most of them played out very one-sided, with a couple of exceptions.

### ::{ flag=PL }:: Rafis vs. ::{ flag=PL }:: Michni (Round of 16)

Even though this match was only partially streamed, it will still bring you to the edge of your seat, there's also video of spazza and shiba casting live so could integrate that in somehow, like "and the rest was history..." and then put the video in of them casting

With that, day 1 was concluded, and the production team along with the players that earned their keep in the brackets got their well-earned time to relax and rest.

## Day 2

Day 2 kicked off a bit later as the venue was only open to the public at 12:00 UTC, with matches supposed to be underway an hour later. As players rushed in to start setting up their gear once again, the organizers had already started preparations on their end as well.

With many lessons learned from yesterday, the latter half of the LAN was slated to run much more smoothly, and even have 2nd stream running to allow for community members to catch any matches that didn't make it onto the main stream.

The matches themselves started getting more heated, with titans of the osu! community clashing live for the world to see, all hoping to snag themselves a top position. Ultimately, it was only one man who stood head and shoulders above everyone, acting as a final boss of the entire tournament — ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961).

recap

After it was all said and done, MALISZEWSKI would be crowned the victor, beating milosz in a dominating fashion with a final score of 7–1. A group photo was taken with all the attendees, staff and players, and that marked the end of the stream, and the 3rd edition of KEL.

Some fun was had after-the-fact, with [Graf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4448391) and [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) facing off [WubWoofWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828) and [bartek22830](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6404027) in a 2v2 on nostalgic osu! maps, using insanely unhinged skins that covered the entire playfield. To add to the insanity, one player was aiming, and the other tapping!

Thank you to everyone who played, staffed, attended, and cheered the players on, both in-person and online! On a personal note, I'd also like to thank the hosts — [flapczek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8210988) and [myksmyks](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6840526) — for letting [Walavouchey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079) and myself in behind the scenes, and allowing us to run around with a phone taking photos and videos of everything. This has been a great experience, and it would not have been the same without their kindness and support.

It's always great to see the osu! community come together and plan amazing events, I can only hope we see more high-quality LANs just like this, and hopefully even have more news posts with IRL coverage.
