Massive applauses to our podium finishers, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073), ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) and ::{ flag=JP }:: [Maimaing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14520910), for creating such an unforgettable final week!

Since the start, we saw every top player from around the world returning, fighting neck and neck with perseverance to get as far as possible. Everyone had predictions on who would come out on top, but certainly no one expected it to come as close as it had been. From a PERFECT, FULL SS of the qualifiers (yes this actually happened), to the close battles in the brackets, all the way until the Grand Finals week, where we witnessed the 11-minute-long TB being played twice, and a bracket reset!

Read on for a detailed rundown of the Grand Finals and [other highlights from this tournament](#match-highlights) below.

Those familiar with EGTS will know that the Grand Finals matchup always used to be fairly one-sided due to the skill disparity between top-seeded players.
In 2020, ::{ flag=CA }:: [janitore](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3307897) went up against ::{ flag=JP }:: [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5321719) who sought to flip the script after being knocked into the lower bracket in semifinals. 
uone proceeded to sweep janitore into a bracket reset and finished the job by defeating him 7-2.

In 2021, ::{ flag=JP }:: [ekumea1123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119501) and ::{ flag=JP }:: [Seren58](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15252950) gave us the closest Grand Finals scoreline thus far with Seren58 resetting the bracket with a 3-7 victory, followed by a 7-4. 

This was not enough for ::{ flag=JP }:: [Seren58](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15252950) though, who came back in 2022 to defeat ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) with a crushing 7-1 victory.

History seemed to repeat itself as ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) pulled ahead with a 5-2 scoreline against ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357).

With ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) picking HD2 and being one of the best, if not the best, HD player in all of osu!taiko, most people watching were ready to congratulate him for his remarkable run in this year's EGTS.
The accuracy was stacked against ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357), but he managed to hold onto the FC while ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) found catastrophic misses in the final ten seconds of HD2 and giving the point, to the shock of everyone, to ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357).

It was a shimmer of hope that ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) proceeded to carry through the entire match in astonishing fashion: winning four points back to back with razor-thin score differences, but also one monumental 90k lead over ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) on HR2.

All of a sudden, ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) was one point away from resetting the bracket and ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073)'s final pick was between one of two incredibly painful maps: NM5, a chaotic polyrhythmic experience, and DT1, a speedy accuracy nightmare.

His choice fell upon NM5, but no one could've anticipated the back-and-forth that ensued.

Both players held on strong until the halfway point when they broke their FCs.
::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) pulled ahead by having fewer misses, but dropped another miss seconds later giving ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) time to build combo and slowly move the score difference back into his advantage.

In the final quarter, ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) dropped another miss, giving a 20k point lead over to ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073), but just as the song drew to a close, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) found another big set of misses, decimating his point lead, but not enough to give it away to kanten_07.

For the first and only time in the history of EGTS, players and viewers alike would be treated to a true world premiere: a genuine Grand Finals tiebreaker; an 11-minute gauntlet at the end of a nerve-wracking one-hour match to decide whether ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) would be crowned the final EGTS champion, or whether he would have to prove himself all over again.

Just two minutes in, the trajectory of the tiebreaker was set with ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) breaking combo while kanten_07 kept the FC well through the first third of the entire map.

::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) managed to build a substantial lead over ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) who kept finding misses over and over, resetting his combo and letting his opponent pull ahead without a worry.

By the end, ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) won with a 47,159 score difference, which is monumental given the sheer length of the tiebreaker, and reset the bracket.

Both players were given a desperately needed 10-minute break.

::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) had just accomplished a feat like no other in the history of EGTS and proved that he was a worthy challenger to the one person who everyone believed could run away with an easy win in Grand Finals.

::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) had dropped only three points in total in his Winners Bracket run of EGTS 2025 before Grand Finals and was just confronted with the very real possibility that his reign might come to an abrupt end.

Neither were willing to give up however and continued to prove that both were just as keen to show that they were deserving of the champion title.

The Bracket Reset saw both players starting the same way they did in their previous match: by asserting their personal strengths over their opponent.
That doesn't mean that their opening picks were easy wins.

In the first match, both players went with HD on FM3 which saw ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) getting one of the biggest leads nearing 170k score.

::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) however decided to switch things up in the Bracket Reset and opted for HR instead.

::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) ended up winning regardless with a near perfect score of 1,042m, but the insanity of ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357)'s FC given the insane reading and accuracy requirement with HR slapped on top of FM2 can simply not be overstated. 

Both continued to not give away any of their own picks, but it was apparent that something had changed in ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073)'s mind.

It showed in his 2x100 FC on FM1 with HD to rectify his 3x100 1 miss play from the previous match, his narrow loss on DT2 despite cutting his 100 count in half and his SS on HD2 until its final ten seconds.
However, everyone began to worry that all of this might not have been enough as the scoreline was still tied at 5-5.

::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357)'s final pick was HR2 which he handily won in the previous match.

The smell of another potential tiebreaker lingered in the air.

Both players started out the same way with ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) trying to keep accuracy high and ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) trying to keep his combo high to punish any of his opponent's misses.

However, to everyone's surprise, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) wanted none of that.

Despite some narrow misses at the start and at the end of HR2, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) didn't drop a single time, reducing his miss count from 73 to 7 and getting tantalizingly close to 99% accuracy, leaving ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) in the dust and securing himself the first breakpoint of the Bracket Reset.

With a 5-6 lead, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) doubled down and picked HR1; a pick which he, too, previously lost against ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357).
By adding insult to injury on the home stretch, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) finished with an FC, replicating his opponent's feat from the previous match with much better accuracy to boot and denying his chance at another tiebreaker.

In the end, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073), the tournament favorite since the very beginning won, but absolutely no one could've anticipated what it took him to get there in the end. 

The Grand Finals of EGTS 2025, much like the entire tournament itself, was a spectacle second to none.

To have two of the game mode's most prolific players push each other to a tiebreaker nearly twice is a historic moment that none of the hundreds of people watching live are sure to forget any time soon.

## Match highlights

### Round of 64: ::{ flag=KR }:: applerss vs. ::{ flag=CL }:: Teruyama

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i9bTn_umKvI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Let's start off these more "miscellaneous" match highlights, with one of, if not the closest match in the Round of 64.

The outcome was all but predictable in ::{ flag=KR }:: [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349) and ::{ flag=CL }:: [Teruyama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9057823)'s first-round match. Despite the major differences in global ranks — applerss at #3 and Teruyama at #128 — and their seeding in EGTS (28th and 37th, respectively), the match was incredibly close. Every single map played on the players' respective picks was decided by a margin of less than 20,000 points, highlighting just how evenly matched they were. Both competitors showcased impressive skill, making it one of the most intense matches of the round.

The full story of this thrilling match cannot be contained in the amounts of paragraph we can make with the amount of content to talk about here, so by all means, go and check out the VOD of this match, as well as the other matches involved if you have not seen EGTS matches before this. You will not be disappointed whatsoever.

### Round of 32: ::{ flag=JP }:: hz404 vs. ::{ flag=JP }:: Shamirin_mzk

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH8JYE3raG0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Round of 32 then started, and what a lineup of players to start off with. ::{ flag=JP }:: [hz404](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14947043), ranked at #14, winning the 2023 edition of [Squad Global Taiko Showdown](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1703263) and finishing 3rd in [Project Prism](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1909279), facing off against ::{ flag=JP }:: [Shamirin_mzk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11325757), ranked at #42, winning the 2021 [Continental Global Taiko Showdown](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/CGTS_2021) tournament, as well as [TWC 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024) with the Japanese team.

With both players having both significant achievements on both the solo leaderboards and tournaments, the match was bound to be exciting. And exciting it was, with the third map, [(The) * Red Room](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325015#taiko/4983573) ending with a 1,382 points difference, giving the win to ::{ flag=JP }:: [hz404](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14947043), for his first point in this match, as ::{ flag=JP }:: [Shamirin_mzk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11325757) was leading by 2 points at this point.

Somehow this was "only" the third lowest point difference, with [Luminosity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325073#taiko/4983703) being a 1,325 points difference, getting ::{ flag=JP }:: [Shamirin_mzk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11325757) to tie up, with a scoreline of 4–4 after this win. And now, the biggest points difference in this match was on the final map being played before the tiebreaker, being [Taffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2324286#taiko/4981586), finishing with an absurd **57** points difference, which is probably one of the lowest non-tie score differences we've seen in this EGTS.

And for the tiebreaker's result, well, how about you go check it out on the VOD itself? You won't be disappointed.

### Round of 16: ::{ flag=JP }:: supesan vs. ::{ flag=US }:: mBiscuit

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ta-RvWKRi64" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Now, for a departure from top players facing off in extra early rounds, for Round of 16's highlight, we will be talking about a match-up of two very underrated players, between ::{ flag=JP }:: [supesan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14623658), who, despite his #185 rank in osu!taiko's pp ranking, seeded #8 through our Qualifiers, and ::{ flag=US }:: [mBiscuit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17061174), who achieved a very respectable seed #46 considering his pp-based rank, being #411.

Nothing really announced this to be such a close match, although ::{ flag=JP }:: [supesan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14623658) definitely has a higher skillcap thanks to his rank, ::{ flag=US }:: [mBiscuit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17061174) is possibly one of the best players in terms of reading and gimmick abilities, and this match showcased all of this in the most perfect ways possible.

Between ::{ flag=US }:: [mBiscuit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17061174) winning on [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2328983#taiko/4994070), [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2328977#taiko/4994051), [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329063#taiko/4994258), [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329068#taiko/4994266), [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329039#taiko/4994216), with all of these being reading-based outside of FM1, which is a consistency pick, and NM4, being the gimmick pick for the round, and ::{ flag=JP }:: [supesan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14623658) winning on [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329033#taiko/4994202), [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329049#taiko/4994233), [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329034#taiko/4994203), [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2328994#taiko/4994086), [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329036#taiko/4994210), and the [Tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329073#taiko/4994275), all of these being some of the more mechanics-focused picks in this pool, this match made for one of the most interesting contrasts to look at for such a close match.

This clip right below summarizes very well how stressful matches in EGTS are to watch, honestly.

### Quarterfinals: ::{ flag=KR }:: Peaceful vs. ::{ flag=JP }:: kanten_07

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3TCnlziD6g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Now we're in for the late stage of EGTS. This is probably now known as one of the biggest upsets in the entire tournament, knowing how good ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) has always been at this level of tournament performance, and it reflected in the pick'ems, with 90.5% of votes predicting a winner going his way.

However, ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) was prepared to prove us wrong, in every way conceivable. The first 4 picks went as planned for both players, each of them won their respective picks, getting to 2–2. But then, ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) picked [HD1, parallel skydive](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2332962#taiko/5006346), and this was the start of the most unexpected run, as he would get 10 misses on it, whereas ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) just went and FC'd it. Despite kanten being known as a No Mod player mainly, he went and stole away a point on a slow SV Hidden map against the best reading player in the game. After that, the match went on for 3 picks in a row, where neither player could even win their own pick, especially with [Fortuna for Tuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2333012#taiko/5006460) being won by Peaceful with a 112 points difference.

    </video>
</div>

Back to a tie again, with 4–4. With each player having one pick left, they manage to both win their respective picks, although it was by 5,429 and 2,567 points respectively, with the last one being especially impressive to look back on...

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <video width="95%" controls>

    </video>
</div>

Tiebreaker reached. 5–5. No other way out of this than by going through a gruesome gauntlet that is [Atomic Disassembler](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2332724#taiko/5005638). The first half was quite trivial for both players, with them being separated by 6x100 by the time the second half started, and somehow, still being at that difference by the time the slowest SV section ended. The song then went into a break-down, and the misses started coming in, with ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) missing 3 in a row, and ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) trading them back with 15 in a row. Everything seemed hopeless at this point, even with 4 additional misses from ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027), but then the very last section came up...

There are no words for what ended up happening.

</div>

::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) won with one of the most decisive ways a tiebreaker could be, a slim 3,775 points difference, and advanced to the Semifinals in the winner's bracket that way.

### Semifinals: ::{ flag=KR }:: Peaceful vs. ::{ flag=JP }:: _Kan2

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f4r-YGyv7k4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

We're now in the first round of Semifinals for the loser's bracket, with a legendary line-up of players to say the least, with ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) on one side, being known as one of the best tournament players in the game, with 4 different TWC podium finishes, and being the current [Project Prism champion](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1909279). On the other side, we have ::{ flag=JP }:: [_Kan2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7160196), having one of the highest skill caps for a tournament player, despite not playing in tournaments, showcased with his 2x miss on [TremENDouS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1632807#taiko/3332914), EGTS 2021's Grand Finals Tiebreaker, being unmatched to this day, and being the only player that has won both Squad Global Taiko Showdowns to ever happen, in 2021, and 2023.

Now, how could this match between such juggernauts of osu!taiko go? Picks for both players were pretty unsurprising, with ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) choosing the reading aspect of the mappool, with [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336583#taiko/5016186), [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336561#taiko/5016142), [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336375#taiko/5015685), [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336556#taiko/5016129), [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336545#taiko/5016102), and [NM6](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336555#taiko/5016128), as a mechanics-oriented final pick. For ::{ flag=JP }:: [_Kan2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7160196), we ended up with [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336548#taiko/5016113), [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336550#taiko/5016115), [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336559#taiko/5016136), [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336376#taiko/5015688), [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336557#taiko/5016130), and [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336377#taiko/5015689) all being picked. This entire match went as according for the first 4 picks, but ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) then lost on HD1, losing the slow Hidden reading for the second match in a row, and giving ::{ flag=JP }:: [_Kan2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7160196) the first break point in this match. Sadly for him though, this would not be the last break point in the match, as ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) ended up retaliating, by first winning [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336376#taiko/5015688) in dominating fashion by FC'ing it, and getting to 4-4, and finally, winning [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336377#taiko/5015689) in one of the most impressive break points to happen, with a 483 points difference, to win the whole match.

</div>

Here we were, the final match deciding who would face off against ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073), in the Grand Finals of EGTS 2025 the following day.

With everyone knowing both players were really good, everyone was expecting this match to be extremely close as it was, especially as it was a revenge match from Semifinals, where ::{ flag=JP }:: [Maimaing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14520910) came out on top, winning 7–5.

However, this time around, despite the very similar scoreline, and with a 6–7 for ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357), the story of the match was very different, with both players truly showing they were ready, and both players ended up winning their 6 respective picks, which is an absurd sight to behold.

With no choice but to play one of the longest and brutal tiebreakers in osu!taiko history to get a chance to continue playing in this tournament, both players started the final map in this match.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-03-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/maimaing-vs-kanten_07-2.png)

However, with the first quarter of the map done, it started looking hopeless, as ::{ flag=JP }:: [Maimaing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14520910) was already 23,145 points ahead. With ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) being 31 misses behind, this seemed like a done deal, especially with none of the song's hard parts having come up yet.

And yet....

Whatever it was that happened in his mind to hit all of this, this was the turning point of the map, as ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) took the lead from that point, and never looked back, winning with a jaw-dropping 7,627 points difference. This whole Grand Finals is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience to enjoy, so make sure to check both matches out.

EGTS, and GTS as a whole, has already been known for its immense contribution to original songs releases in the osu! sphere, having released **73** songs in its existence, prior to EGTS 2025's release.

Due to that, we think there were a lot of expectations on how many we would be releasing, especially with [COEGTS 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/COEGTS_2023), which was holding the record for the tournament with the most original songs attached to it, being 29. 

This record was not beaten to this day, or well, until EGTS 2025 finalized, with us having released a grand total of **37 original songs** for this tournament. You can find all of these songs on the [Bespoke osu! music wiki article](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music#community-run-tournament-releases) for quick access, under the "Expert Global Taiko Showdown 2025" section.

We will be highlighting our biggest non-Tiebreaker track in this article as well, along with showcasing all tiebreakers as well.

### Round of 64

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-03-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/Song_Banners_RO64.png)

<div class="osu-md__paragraph">

    </audio>
</div>

[blobdash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8337877) makes his return to GTS in grand fashion, with "[VOID ELEVATOR](https://soundcloud.com/blobdash/void-elevator)", returning after his three songs provided to [EGTS 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022), and having become a reliable part of GTS since then, having participated in [RGTS 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/RGTS_2022) to compose its Grand Finals Tiebreaker, as well as having composed the Main Mappool NM1 for [COEGTS 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/COEGTS_2023), and having been the BGM artist for the story sections in [EGTS 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022) and [COEGTS 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/COEGTS_2023), as well as becoming the Mastering Engineer for [BespokE : GTS 2023](https://gratiaproductions.bandcamp.com/album/bespoke-gts-2023). With a track that has waited 2 years to be able to release, he has still managed to make one of the most impressive tracks to start off the first round of EGTS 2025 with, and the map provided by [Gamelan4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2140739) and [Shinsekai-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2140739) has helped players ease into the high level of gameplay that EGTS is shooting for very well.

### Round of 32

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-03-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/Song_Banners_RO32.png)

<div class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <audio controls>
        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/egts-2025-conviction.mp3">
    </audio>
</div>

We then moved on to quite a different style for this tiebreaker, being a more rock/speedcore-focused song, rhythms changing all over the board, and one professional grade type of song, despite the composer, [trailmix37](https://soundcloud.com/trailmix38), being completely unknown to begin with, having 52 subscribers on SoundCloud, not a single osu! map submitted for any of his 4 past songs, but if you were to play this without knowing any of this context? You would not notice it whatsoever. Mappers [davidminh0111](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2140739) and [SolaEclipse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2140739) did not hold back whatsoever after hearing this song, with some of these sections able to trip you up, no matter the mod that was chosen, and you can see this even in the matches that attempted this map.

### Round of 16

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-03-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/Song_Banners_RO16.png)

<div class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <audio controls>
        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/egts-2025-the-great-revelation-by-mother-brain.mp3">
    </audio>
</div>

Oh, did I say the past song changed styles? Okay, maybe this one does too. To quite an absurd amount. A massive departure from the melancholic hype that the two songs before possessed, and this one is just shooting to be a massive bomb, being a 5 minutes Frenchcore track by [Mothtek](https://soundcloud.com/mothtek), one of the more prolific artists in the Japanese Hardtek scene, and with the song being named "[The Great Revelation By Mother Brain](https://soundcloud.com/mothtek/mothtek-the-great-revelation-by-mother-brainegts2025-round-of-16-tiebreaker)", and at some point, you start to ask yourself, when does it stop? The answer is never. Mappers [Ideal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3869519) and [Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650) tried to reel this insane song in a bit, by making it a bit easier in terms of pure mechanics compared to the Round of 32, as it instead aims to be played with mods by the players left, but even then, it is a struggle for sure.

### Quarterfinals

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-03-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/Song_Banners_QF.png)

<div class="osu-md__paragraph">

</div>

[Atomic Disassembler.](https://soundcloud.com/yusuke-7328/atomic-disassembler)

This title summarizes the goal behind this song pretty well. The tiebreaker for this year's Quarterfinals by [CS4W](https://soundcloud.com/yusuke-7328) has arrived, being a Gothic Hardcore song, mixed with Hi-tech and Drum & Bass elements, for one of the most insane mixes of genres I've ever seen, and the map by [My Angel Seia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17797595) has absolutely nothing angelic about it. The easy parts are when 220BPM streams are mapped at the normal SV, but whenever you see a single SV slowdown in this map, the only answer is to run, frankly.

### Semifinals

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-03-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/Song_Banners_SF.png)

<div class="osu-md__paragraph">

        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/egts-2025-white-tiger.mp3">
    </audio>
</div>      

Where do we even start with this song. With a song mainly based on Oriental vibes, [Xyris](https://soundcloud.com/itsxyris), being no stranger to the osu! tournament scene, having provided songs to the [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K), and [Resurrection Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/RESC/2024), where he has also notably been in charge of Quality Assurance for Song Production, he definitely understood the assignemnt here as well, and throws out crazy mixes of Speedcore and Dubstep, to make for some of the most challenging bursts, and mappers [Briesmas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2865172) and [MTNTWarz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2865172), heavily accompanied by head mappoolers [4sbet1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671) and [Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650) have created one of the most daunting maps in this tournament for sure, and this map shows it as well, by being the second-highest tiebreaker by SR, being higher than the Finals Tiebreaker.

### Finals

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-03-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/Song_Banners_F.png)

<div class="osu-md__paragraph">

        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/egts-2025-justice-rectifier.mp3">
    </audio>
</div>    

And now that we're on it, let's talk about this Finals Tiebreaker, "[Justice Rectifier](https://soundcloud.com/foodbot/justice-rectifier)" by [Foodbot](https://soundcloud.com/foodbot), [Type R](https://soundcloud.com/hiimtype_r) and [SDMNE](https://soundcloud.com/sdmne), with two brand-new artists to GTS this year, as well as SDMNE, coming back from his regular GTS appearances in EGTS 2021 and 2022, as well as MGTS and COEGTS 2023. This whole song was quite the challenge to even finalize for everyone involved, with this being born out of another song being cancelled last minute, hence being made from December 2nd 2024, and composition being officially finalized on March 9th 2025, exactly 7 days before release. However, nothing here shows any corners being cut, with one of the most melodic songs in our late stage, and being an incredible mix of genres, between Hardcore Techno, Gabber, as well as Hi-Tech. And with the map made by one of the best mappers trio possible with [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767), [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/532171910), and [kei821](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5846289), it did not disappoint, despite having been forced to be made in three total days, making up for an amazing experience overall, to prepare for the Grand Finals Tiebreaker.

### Grand Finals

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-03-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/Song_Banners_GFHR2.png)

<div class="osu-md__paragraph">

        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/egts-2025-absolute-disorder.mp3   ">
    </audio>
</div>    

This is the only non-tiebreaker song to be discussed here, but with good reason to do so.
Our Grand Finals Hard Rock 2 pick, "[AbsoluTe disoRdeR](https://soundcloud.com/abs_dsr/absolute-disorder)" by [Acute Disarray](https://soundcloud.com/abs_dsr) (Now revealed to be an unit of [AiSS](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCySx3jmK0bjwiwix_EoKm4w) participating for Orzmic, [rN](https://soundcloud.com/rurinn) participating for Phigros, [takehirotei](https://soundcloud.com/takehirotei) participating for GTS, [Riya](https://soundcloud.com/riyaelectronic) participating for A Dance of Fire and Ice), was an original song released for EGTS 2025, but also as a 4-way collaboration, with three of the rhythm games we collaborated with throughout EGTS, being [Phigros](https://x.com/Phigros_PGS), [Orzmic](https://x.com/orzmic) and [A Dance of Fire and Ice](https://7thbe.at/), with the song releasing on all of the following games as well. The sheer scale this collaboration is on is definitely absurd, and the map made by [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976) for it definitely follows it, on top of that song being a very defining pick for both Grand Finals matches this week. Due to the special aspect of it, it's a song that is not planned to be allowed to be mapped freely, but a full spread on all gamemodes is planned to be made for this song. Do give it time.

</div>

And the final song of EGTS 2025, that truly speaks for itself, being our Grand Finals Tiebreaker: [《wr/d.:colliders》~Chaos in Conclusion~](https://soundcloud.com/blobdash/wrld-colliders) by the GTS Sound Team. 
A completely absurd collaboration on all levels, involving **20** composers, **35** mappers, and **15** designers, on an 11-minutes long brutal song, with a full music video on top of it.
The final product speaks for itself, so I will let you enjoy it.

[kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) has been 2nd place finish of this year's EGTS, also having one of the most surprising bracket runs in the entire tournament, forcing the closest Grand Finals in EGTS history.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kasumi-sama.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263">Kasumi-sama</a></p>

You've had the most impressive run in this year's EGTS, with a lot of upsets to your name. How did you feel after these numerous upsets you managed to get, and how did you prepare for them?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/kanten_07.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357">kanten_07</a></p>

Thank you! Personally, I was more surprised than happy when I won Quarterfinals against Peaceful and the first round of Grand Finals against Grape_Tea. To be honest, it didn't really set in that I had won.
Shortly after, the realization set in that I had actually won, and I was very happy.
I hung out with other players after winning and reflected on the positives and negatives of the game.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kasumi-sama.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263">Kasumi-sama</a></p>

Are there any other players in the tournament that surprised you with their performance during the tournament?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/kanten_07.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357">kanten_07</a></p>

In the tournament, we essentially had the same practice schedule every week; on Monday and Tuesday, we would figure out the map trends, the order of picks and bans for most of them, and which maps would increase our chances of winning.

By Wednesday, we had made enough notes of most of the maps, and on Thursday, we fixed finger placements and color pattern recognition in order to make those notes consistent with a real performance.

From Friday until just before the matches, we didn't practice all that much, but played the maps as if we were playing a real match, checked if there were any weak parts or habits to note, and if there were, we simply tried to correct them.

The two people that surprised me with their performance were [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) and [chibamasu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16067522);

- [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) really surprised me by SSing every map in the Qualifiers, and with their overwhelming consistency in the map pools every week.
- I played against [chibamasu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16067522) in Round of 32, and I was impressed when they FC'd every FM map with HDHR and when they SS'd the NM5 map. Their HD skill and overall consistency really surprised me. Their HD2 play at the All-Star Showcase was impressive as well.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-03-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/interview_4sbet1.png)

[4sbet1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671) was one of the head mappoolers for this year's EGTS, having helped tremendously in terms of improving communication with Japanese users as well as having worked upon a huge part of the general mappooling work with [ekumea1123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119501), especially for later stages.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kasumi-sama.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263">Kasumi-sama</a></p>

Despite being a top player for years, this mappooling experience has been your first ever on an international tournament. Coming in with such a big amount of restrictions, with the mappool being fully custom-mapped, involving a lot of original songs to balance into it as well, how did it feel organising all of this?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/4sbet1.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671">4sbet1</a></p>

To be honest, I thought it was a really interesting challenge!
At the same time, I felt a lot of pressure—considering the obligation to keep so many amazing custom / collab songs confidential until the end, and the responsibility to provide maps that live up to their difficulty and quality...

Also, in order to use each custom / collab song in the most optimal way, it was necessary to analyze the elements of each song and each slot in every round and assign them appropriately. The process of trial and error, rearranging the slots to find the right balance, felt like solving a puzzle—it was genuinely fun.

(By the way, I’m not a top player… I was already an old man two years ago!)

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kasumi-sama.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263">Kasumi-sama</a></p>

This edition of EGTS has been the first one to involve so many Japanese users in the mapping and playtesting team, thanks to your efforts and ekumea1123's effort. How was the ambience like in such a staffing team, that had two very different languages being spoken, as well as vastly different cultures over the game.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/4sbet1.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671">4sbet1</a></p>

When I first became a Head Pooler, I never expected that people from around the world and the Japanese community would come to build such a warm and close relationship.

For Japanese Taiko players, who are usually part of a relatively closed-off community, EGTS2025 has undoubtedly been a powerful and positive influence!
This outcome was made possible thanks to the GTS community members, who opened their hearts and reached out to us!
We Japanese need to learn from this kind of open-mindedness as well.

To be honest, ekumea1123 did more work than I did, and I also received a tremendous amount of help from Briesmas, goheegy, and Raphalge. Please don’t forget about them either.

A brand-new addition from this year's GTS releases, [Foodbot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35127759) has been one of the most active composers in EGTS, working on **4** different song projects for this tournament alone, having been a part of the [Finals No Mod 4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340046#taiko/5026842) with the Spaceport Sound Team, also having made the [Finals Tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340085#taiko/5026904), *Justice Rectifier*, with [Type R](https://soundcloud.com/hiimtype_r) and [SDMNE](https://soundcloud.com/sdmne), [deadline chasers, the Grand Finals No Mod 4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343520#taiko/5037773) with [Kyotsugyon](https://soundcloud.com/kyotsugyon), as well as having been part of the [Grand Finals Tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343549#taiko/5037847).

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kasumi-sama.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263">Kasumi-sama</a></p>

You were one of the composers that participated in the most original songs released in EGTS, having been involved in 4 of them. With all of these having been collaborations, how did it feel having to tackle all of these vastly different organisations, and what have you felt was the biggest challenge while working on this tournament?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35127759" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Foodbot.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35127759">Foodbot</a></p>

It was interesting. I honestly think since most of them are in context of a collaboration, it's not as much work as I'd imagine. For 'deadline chasers', Kyotsugyon was handling most of the composition and arrangement (I did most of the hitech stuff though), and I barely lifted a finger for 'Strive;'.

《wr/d.:colliders》... it's a weird story. I had listened to Kry's part beforehand, and thought "Oh, he wants someone to make This kind of drop." ...but I never really loved making that kind of drop, so wanted to make something that people will least expect but still sound very good.
Like I said in wrldcollider's youtube comment: "I took Kry's buildup, threw it, and violently crushed it to the ground."
(Please note that I don't hate Kry.exe at all. I respect him a lot.)
I was also asked by the host like this:
"speed"
"please"
So, um. there you go. LOL. Speed.
I didn't even know of the name 'splittercore' before EGTS 2025, i just thought of super-fast speedcore overlayed with dubstep drums to make it hit harder than it normally would.
Some people also say I'm "on crack". I promise you that's not the case.

Justice Rectifier is another layer of hell. I've never made any tiebreaker songs before, and looking back, I somewhat wish I didn't make it as slow as 170BPM as a starting point. But it definitely gives it its own vibe for a tiebreaker.
When asked by the hosts to transition to a 200+ BPM section, I was hesitant on what to make. They shared some references that would fit the theme, and what I think what I ended up making was super unique. Although some people mistook it for Type R's part, I can't blame them. I would've thought the same.

I'm planning to detail more of the music-making process for Justice Rectifier on youtube at some point. Hopefully by the time this newspost is published I would be able to finish it in time.

You were already involved in osu! in the past, having provided songs to VNMC2024, as well as the osu! Collegiate League. While having worked for two different gamemodes already, was working on a song for an osu!taiko tournament any different, and what were the things you were mainly paying attention to while composing, compared to usual?

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35127759">Foodbot</a></p>

I was provided references for each slots. I was also given regular feedback by mappoolers so the composition fits more in a osu!taiko setting, and that was definitely the BIGGEST difference compared to other tournaments where I had only recieved "make whatever you want" prompts.

I wasn't really paying attention to anything other than composing based on the references I've been given, but I always take the feedbacks in mind, because in the end I'm making this song for a tournament, and I got to make it fit somehow.
Also because of the feedback, I get a better understanding of osu!taiko patterns in charting.
In the end, it almost feels like I'm making a song for a music label, and it's an incredibly refreshing experience.

[Z419](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966) (a.k.a. Zeth) has been the main designer for this final edition of EGTS, being in charge of making the most appealing designs possible for everything that was not an original song in this tournament.

With EGTS 2025 being such a massive gathering of original songs, how did it affect your personal experience in terms of designing for this tournament?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Z419.jpg')"></a>

It 100% was a super fun experience for me personally, being able to work with so many different music artists and come up with all the visuals for so many different things, and the chances to collaborate between the different designers on many of these projects is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I think many viewers of EGTS are equally as excited as us, waiting for each week's new visuals for the custom songs, so I just hope everyone enjoyed the designs as much as we enjoyed making them.

How was the working environment like in the tournament, especially in the designers' channel? Did engaging with other designers and musicians help motivate your creativity?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Z419.jpg')"></a>

Most of the originals are done with lots of coordination between the staff and the various Illustrators/Designers/VFX artists so it is pretty well managed and organised, though the deadline chasing was definitely something that May Have Taken A Toll on some of us so it is stressful to say the least LOL.

About the designers' channel... yeah. The world probably needs to see the design channel and all the dumb things that happened on there (which by the way is renamed to #anything-but-design so feel free to make of that what you will), but having a group of designers that so frequently banter and talk about dumb things in the channel during the making of EGTS helped a lot in managing the stress and many of us have bonded because of this and have had even more chances to work together outside of the tournament since then.

Creativity-wise, it was sometimes challenging because having to come up with a new design (especially when some of us are taking more songs than others) for each song while trying to make it unique amongst each other is a difficult thing to do, but the designers usually will share a lot of inspirations from other people's art and design which helped making it easier for me to find a starting point when starting to work on it. The collaborations between the designers and/or illustrators also have gave birth to many creative new art from the combination between 2 (sometimes very distinctly different) styles of work, which is very refreshing to do.

[overdahedge2015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847) has been a force to be reckoned with in tournament staffing over the years, having been a playtester for numerous taiko tournaments, and EGTS was no stranger to this, as he was the head playtester for this tournament as well.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kasumi-sama.jpg')"></a>

While having been the main playtester for this tournament, having playtested half of the pools nearly entirely by yourself, how hard is it to keep in mind your own player opinions, as well as trying to balance them what would be best for the mappools?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/overdahedge2015.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847">overdahedge2015</a></p>

I wouldn't even say this is necessarily hard, more so just tricky, and being in a smaller pool of testers definitely doesn't help. 

To perfectly account for your own personal biases, you'd also need to know your exact skillset, as in, how good you are at X compared to Y for just about every relation between two skills, and getting most of the way there isn't too hard if you have some self-awareness but everyone whiffs on it sometimes: I called grand finals HR1 "too easy" but it was still getting misses out of the podium players even without buffs that I was hoping for, but I was wrong! 

To be fair, I was never there for the sake of testing the late rounds, and I have to thank miyagishima, kitafuma, and Seren for carrying me on that front, but the same idea can happen in any given round really. A handful of opinions is so much nicer to work with than one, and for a while I really did feel like the only playtester doing anything, but in EGTS' case the head poolers were all top players and all did a ton of work for the tourney, so they thankfully had their own judgment to work with.

After your experiences in tournaments, how do you think the tournament scene should move forward with its mappool system?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/overdahedge2015.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847">overdahedge2015</a></p>

I sort of have two answers to this.

As a staff member, I want to say there's a reasonable future where all mappools use only fully licensed music and can still be great, but while it's getting easier every month i think it's still very hard to execute when you don't have the sheer manpower a tourney like EGTS has. 

As someone that's pooling for RGTS right now, it's unreal and honestly, a bit demotivating, the amount of times I have thought "oh this map would be great", then looked in the source field and saw that the song's from another rhythm game, but we're still making it work, with the help of a good but not EGTS-level amount of custom mappers.

As a player, I think current pool structure is honestly great! I think being too picky makes pooling hellish, and as long as polyrhythm HR1s stay away from me it's all okay in my book.

As a final way to wrap up this whole article, we thought there would be only one way to ask our staff members to finish the very last EGTS edition, so here it is:
