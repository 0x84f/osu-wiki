We would like to thank the mappool selectors for their hard work this year. Together with the mappers and playtesters, they worked on the best possible quality for everyone. This doesn't only include choosing maps, but also mapping them and giving specifications to our amazing artists this year.

Meet ::{ flag=SE }:: [Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650), a longstanding contributor to pooling, mapping and playtesting for the osu!taiko World Cups. Unfortunately, he is retiring from his mappool selector position going forward, so we took the chance and asked for a few insights. Answers that we **and** you always wanted to know, now you get to chance to learn more!

Pooling for official tournaments is not much different from smaller community endeavours. The biggest difference is the format; a country-locked 3vs3 format is very uncommon for Taiko. It makes difficulty balancing a bigger challenge since you need to keep top players engaged without completely stonewalling the weakest links. However, with how competitive a lot of matches ended up being, I'd say things turned out quite nicely!

As for osu! originals, spitballing ideas with composers is always a ton of fun! Especially when things immediately click. Quarkee's HYPER PSY2K for example was just a simple 2-step process of "hey quarkee do you wanna make a fast psytrance thing?" -> "yeah sounds cool" and then receiving an absolute banger a month later. I think we put people on pedestals too often, because I've found that the most grounded exchanges often yield the best results.

Building on that, I'd like to tell future mappoolers to not think they're unqualified or overthink things. You will mess up, you will feel like an idiot and you will take mappool feedback too personally. It's proof that you care about the product and people having a good time, and it's only through failures that we gain experience and grow stronger. Don't be afraid to throw your dart at the board—even if it ends up breaking something.

For TWC 2025, [Coppertine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7279762) was responsible for the storyboard creation of the Grand Finals tiebreaker BUZZ CUTZ, which stands as the longest osu! original ever featured in World Cups. Her previous contributions span across multiple World Cups, including the storyboard for Operation: Zenithfall in OWC 2024.

Yo! I am Coppertine, I have been a storyboarder since 2016 and have made various storyboards over the time. People may know of me as the storyboarder of [wafer's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9416836) infamous map [Uncanny long arms](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2094154#osu/4390731). I have also worked along side [Enkrypton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5178122) for CWC 2024's Grand Finals NM2 pick of [WangleLine's](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/427) [Journey to the rabbit moon base](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202809#fruits/5042330) , and the OWC 2024 Grand Finals Tiebreaker pick of [Camellia's](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31) [Operation: Zenithfall](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287992#osu/4881796) along side Enkrypton, [VenerableNyanta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12243368) and [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323).

I normally create with [storybrew](https://github.com/Damnae/storybrew/), a C# based storyboard creation tool from the wonderful [Damnae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/989377), to enhance the experience of the beatmap whilst ensuring my storyboard creations can be enjoyed by many with a focus on storytelling and atmospheric styles in mind.

This year’s TWC featured the longest osu! original ever created in World Cups, with an impressive 10-minute tiebreaker track. While this presented a unique creative opportunity, it also introduced significant challenges for storyboard creation. How did you and the rest of the design team approach the visual progression across the video and storyboard? Were there any ideas that worked particularly well, or others that had to be revised or dropped along the way?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7279762" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/coppertine.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7279762">Coppertine</a></p>

Gaining a sense of the visual process for this project wasn't easy. Especially with an extremely niche genre at an ultra long duration. Something that was done before, even in a tiebreaker context, but dariacore was one of those genres unexplored for almost all storyboarders even today.

Even with that in mind, we were pretty quick to gain tones of ideas, in fact, my first ever idea when I checked out the song was that I wanted some form of a black and white strobing effect within the song. Other than that, we essentially went off with the brief of a simple male character with a blue themed storyboard about self-identity and music creation.

First thing we did was a simple VC call where the team brainstormed ideas and an overall storyline for the visual side of the song. We started with the character design of Tatsuma, where [Celestial](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9108428) and [Hiro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15251809) drew multiple sketches. Those sketches were further refined in the following weeks. At the same time, [Kuroise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127) started off by writing story beats for each section of the storyboard.

As the illustrations were being produced, [Iyouka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7138499) worked on lyrics text overlay for [CrewK’s](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604) cyan abstract like animation that [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024) composited all together in a 3D LED screen style video for the intro. Luckily, I created a little effect that acted like the LED backlights that helped compliment the video and allowed others to use the video at full resolution on their own beatmaps.

Throughout development of the storyboard, a lot of scenes were revised. For example, one major section that had to be toned down a lot was what I internally call the "[flashing section (Epilepsy Warning)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K-ruOYQTss)". Found 8 and a half minutes in, it was an extremely simple scene with Tatsuma and the background both flashing through 4 different states with overlay segments throughout. However, upon initial feedback, the frame rate had to be lowered in half and was given a aqua colour tint to make the scene a lot less harmful to the eyes.

It’s great to have you back for another Grand Finals tiebreaker project, following your work on Camellia’s Operation: Zenithfall for OWC 2024. What many might not know is that you were responsible for revising the Zenithfall storyboard prior to its ranking, a process that spanned over a month of ongoing effort. In contrast, the storyboard for this year’s TWC reached Qualified status just two hours after submission, which was a surprising turnaround. What changes did you and your team make this time to optimize storyboard creation?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7279762" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/coppertine.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7279762">Coppertine</a></p>

I'd say that of the biggest changes we had from Operation: Zenithfall to BUZZ CUTZ was how everyone was focused on storyline, not just for the video but the video and entire storyboard combined. From artists illustrating Tatsuma in various situations to Kuroise and I being in voice call day and night working on the storyboard, the productivity has vastly improved throughout the project.

Another big step-up we have done is storyboard optimization. Instead of using the full resolution assets, we cropped and reduced the file size for each of our assets. While the initial version of the Operation: Zenithfall storyboard had an enormous file size upon showcase, we have been able to have the BUZZ CUTZ storyboard in a rankable state before upload.

Altogether, I felt that we as a team have made designs that is both cohesive and enjoyable just a couple days before reveal. I myself am proud of our creation and am happy to see people like Tatsuma as well as we do!
