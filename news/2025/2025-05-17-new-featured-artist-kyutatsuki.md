Sound waves from another dimension have been transported directly to our Featured Artist library!

**Kyutatsuki** first found their way into osu! through community tournaments, especially catching the attention of osu!mania players. That recognition is what led to **Kyutatsuki**'s involvement in the osu!mania 4K World Cup 2024 Grand Finals tiebreaker, [Fractal Vertex](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2253784), so it was only a matter of time before **Kyutatsuki** joined our Featurerd Artists!

**5** tracks are officially part of [**Kyutatsuki**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/476), paired with pre-timed beatmap templates. Map one of them, or map all of them. We'll leave you to it.

Experience what the self-proclaimed *Sound Shaper from Another Dimension* has to offer:

If the previews and map templates above aren't enough for you, you can ogle [**Kyutatsuki**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/476) until an uncontrollable urge to map takes over.

What's on the horizon for next weekend? Could it be another Featured Artist announcement? The answer is a definitive "yes". Sorry to ruin the surprise.

Stay tuned until then!
