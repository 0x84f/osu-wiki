# Break

**Breaks** are sections of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) which have no [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object). During this time, [health drain](/wiki/Gameplay/Health) is temporarily halted. Breaks usually allow the player to rest their arm for a short while and reposition their [input device](/wiki/Gameplay/Input_device).

Depending on the enabled [settings](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Song_setup), letterboxes may appear when a break is initiated. In addition to this, a passing or failing graphic and sound may appear to indicate if a player is doing well or not. This will only appear if there is enough time for the graphic to show, and will not appear if the mode is osu!mania. The player's current [grade](/wiki/Gameplay/Grade) may be shown at the top right corner of the screen.
