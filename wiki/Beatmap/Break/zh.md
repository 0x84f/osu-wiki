# 休息时段

**休息时段**是[谱面](/wiki/Beatmap)的一部分，此时没有[打击物件](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object)。在此时段期间，会暂时[掉血](/wiki/Gameplay/Health) is temporarily halted. Breaks usually allow the player to rest their arm for a short while and reposition their [input device](/wiki/Gameplay/Input_device).

Depending on the enabled [settings](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Song_setup), letterboxes may appear when a break is initiated. In addition to this, a passing or failing graphic and sound may appear to indicate if a player is doing well or not. This will only appear if there is enough time for the graphic to show.
