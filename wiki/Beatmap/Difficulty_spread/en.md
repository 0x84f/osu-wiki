# Difficulty spread

A **difficulty spread** is a set of [difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty) sorted by [star rating](/wiki/Beatmap/Star_rating) in ascending order, such that:

- There are no missing [difficulty levels](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty#difficulty-levels) â€” every required difficulty between the easiest and the hardest ones from the spread's range is present.
  - Difficulties lower than the lowest difficulty level required, as determined by [spread rules](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#rules.1), can be considered as optional and excluded from spread requirements.
- There are no significant difficulty gaps between two adjacent difficulties.

The difficulty spread is a [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) requirement.
