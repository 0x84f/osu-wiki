# Difficulty spread

A **difficulty spread** is a set of [difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty) sorted by [star rating](/wiki/Beatmap/Star_rating) in ascending order, such that:

- There are no missing [difficulty levels](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty#difficulty-levels) â€” every difficulty between the easiest and the hardest ones from the spread's range is present.
- There are no significant difficulty gaps between two adjacent difficulties.

The difficulty spread is a [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) requirement.
