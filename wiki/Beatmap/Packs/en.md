# Beatmap packs

A beatmaps pack is a compressed file containing beatmaps. It is worth noting that the most packs are:

- Roughly either ~100MB (Taiko/osu!mania) or ~200MB (-/Approved) <!-- TODO: Classifying like this looks inappropriate -->
- Contain videos (if included)

## Naming

The filename of the pack is based on its content, category, and upload order. For example, a beatmap pack file named:

```
F2 - Rohi Pack.zip
```

`F2` means the second beatmap pack under the Featured Artist category, while `Rohi Pack` refers to the pack's name shown on the beatmap packs website. This pack includes Rohi's songs only.

Sometimes numbers exist in beatmap pack names, especially for Standard packs. As beatmaps in most of them are just close in time, thus using numbers to indicate their upload order. For example, `Approved Beatmap Pack #7` contains only  [approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved) beatmaps, and it is the 7th uploaded beatmap pack.

## Categories

Beatmaps packs are split into 7 categories, with a special letter indicator:

| Indicator | Category | Beatmap types |
| :-: | :-- | :-- |
| **S** | Standard | Ranked or Approved beatmaps |
| **F** | Featured Artist | High-quality songs from the [Featured Artists](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists) |
| **T** | Tournament | Tournament-specific beatmaps <!-- TODO: Uncertain about its real use--> |
| **L** | Project Loved | Beatmaps chosen by the community in [Project Loved](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) |
| **R** | Spotlights | Seasonal beatmap challenge packs by [Beatmap Spotlights](wiki/Beatmap_Spotlights), formly known as **Charts** |
| **T** | Theme | Theme based beatmaps |
| **A** | Artist/Album | Artist/Album based beatmaps |

## Fully Completing Your Song List

This is for those who really want to *fully complete your song list* (and not just download your favourite songs).

Keep in mind that you will need quite a lot of digital space to storage these beatmaps. As beatmap packs (and torrents) also downloads with the video and other beatmap skinnable elements.

### Beatmap Pack Listing

Download all the (-/Approved/Taiko/osu!mania) beatmaps packs from the **Standard** category and nowhere else. The (-/Approved/Taiko/osu!mania) beatmaps packs will contain all the songs in the other 3 categories.

The beatmaps packs can be found and downloaded from: [osu! Beatmaps Packs page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs).
