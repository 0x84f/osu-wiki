# Anchors

**Anchors**, usually referring to a byproduct of [streams](Mania/Streams) or sometimes [chordjacks](Mania/Jacks/en.md#chordjacks), are when a high concentration of notes in one column appear in consecutive snap intervals, typically in 1/2nd snap intervals. The name **anchor** comes from the motion the pattern creates, in which your finger is essentially anchored to that key due to the consecutive, intervallic presses.
