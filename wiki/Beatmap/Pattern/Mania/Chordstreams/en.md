# Chordstreams

_For stream types specific to 4-key, refer to [streams](mania/streams)._

**Chordstreams** are a type of [stream](wiki/pattern/mania/streams/en.md#streams) which involve different chord sizes. The stream is usually on 1/4th with chords every 1/1st or 1/2nd snap interval. In keymodes outside of 4-key osu!mania, **chordstream** usually refers to streams involving 3 or more notes within the chords.

**Chordstream** may also include **double streams**, which are two streams occurring simultaneously. These are more common in 7-key osu!mania and key modes above.

## Brackets

A specific type of chordstream involves the usage of 2 or more [trills](wiki/pattern/mania/trills/en.md#trills) occurring at the same time are known as **brackets**, though the trills may switch columns. They usually occur when chordstreams are quite dense with its chord usage and usually mix both one-handed trills and two-handed trills together.
