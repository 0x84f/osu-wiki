# Jacks

Within specific pattern context, **jacks** are typically used to refer to 3 or more consecutive notes within the same column. They are referred to as **jacks** since the motion required to play them mimics the motion of a jackhammer.

Commonly, the term **jack** can also refer to the general idea of having consecutive notes in the same column. Any of the following specifications can be referred to as just **jacks**.

## Minijack

A **minijack** is a type of **jack** which only features two notes and is the least demanding version of a **jack**.

## Longjack

A **longjack** is a more strenuous type of **jack** which typically uses 4 or more consecutive notes. This term may also be used when the same consecutive jumps or hands are used.

## Chordjack

**Chordjacks** features a mix of different types of jacks along with chords. Commonly, this term is only used for patterns denser than [quadstreams](mania/streams/quadstreams) and as such a more frequent usage of chords is required.
