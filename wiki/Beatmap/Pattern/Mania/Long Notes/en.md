# Long Notes

Also referred to in-game as holds, **long notes** are notes that require you to hold and release them afterwards. They are often referred to as LNs for short and are used to represent prolonged sounds in the music.

**Releases** are known to be their own term. It refers to the ending of a **long note**, the part that requires you to release the key.

## Shields

**Shields** occur when a note is placed consecutively before a long note in the same column. They play very similarly to [minijacks](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/Mania/Jacks/en.md#Minijack).

**Reverse shields** occur when a consecutive note follows a long note's release.

## Inverse

**Inverse** is a type of long note pattern in which all the notes in each column are long notes and after each release, another long note follows in that column. This creates what looks like a wall of long notes and forms dense patterning with heavier reliance on reading.
