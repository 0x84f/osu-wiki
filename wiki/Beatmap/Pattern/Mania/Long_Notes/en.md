# Long Notes

Also referred to as holds in the editor, **long notes** are notes that require you to hold and release them afterwards. They are often referred to as noodles or LNs and are used to represent prolonged sounds in the music.

**Releases** refers to the ending of a **long note**, the part that requires you to release the key. They are known to have their own term due to release timing in osu!mania being taken into consideration when awarding judgements for the entire long note.

## Shields

**Shields** occur when a note is placed consecutively before a long note in the same column. They play very similarly to [minijacks](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/Mania/Jacks/en.md#Minijack).

**Reverse shields** occur when a consecutive note follows a long note's release within the same column.

## Inverse

**Inverse** is a type of long note pattern in which all the notes in each column are long notes and after each release, another long note follows in that column. This creates what looks like a wall of long notes and forms dense patterning with heavier reliance on reading.
