# Trill

A **Trill** is three or more consecutive notes that alternate between two different columns.

**Trills** are often characterized based on whether they require two hand movements or one. These are known as **one-handed trills** and **two-handed trills**.

## Chordtrill, jumptrill and split-trill

**Chordtrills** make use of two consecutive alternating chords instead of singular notes. They can also be imagined as multiple trills occurring at once within the same snap intervals of each other.

There are two main types of **chordtrills**. There are **chordtrills** which require each chord to be played with one hand known as **jumptrills**.

The other type, **split-trills**, require each chord to be played with two hands.

For 4-key osu!mania, these are the only types of **chordtrills**. As such, the term **chordtrill** is more likely to be used in higher key modes.
