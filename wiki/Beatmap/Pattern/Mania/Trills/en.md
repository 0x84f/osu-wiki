# Trills

A **Trill** is three or more consecutive notes that alternate between two different columns.

**Trills** are often characterized based on whether they require two hand movements or one. These are known as **one-handed trills** and **two-handed trills**.

## Chordtrills, Jumptrills and Split-Trills

**Chordtrills** make use of two consecutive alternating chords instead of singular notes.

There are two main types of **chordtrills**. There are **chordtrills** which require each chord to be played with one hand known as **jumptrills**.

The other type, **split-trills**, require each chord to be played with two hands.

For 4-key osu!mania, these are the only types of **chordtrills**. As such, the term **chordtrill** is more likely to be used in higher key modes.
