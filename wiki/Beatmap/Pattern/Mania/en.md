# osu!mania Patterns

A **pattern** is a small set of [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) within a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) arranged in a meaningful way. In osu!mania, this can be done with either **notes**, **long notes**, or a combination of the two.

## Universal pattern types

## Patterns specific to higher keymodes
