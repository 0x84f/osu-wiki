# Chordstream

*For stream types specific to 4-key, refer to [Stream](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Stream).*

**Chordstreams** are a type of [stream](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Stream) which involve different chord sizes. The stream is usually on 1/4 with chords every 1/1 or 1/2 snap interval. In key modes outside of 4K, "chordstream" usually refers to streams involving 3 or more notes within the chords.

**Chordstreams** may also include **double streams**, which are two streams occurring simultaneously. These are more common in 7K osu!mania or higher key modes.

## Bracket

**Brackets** are a specific type of chordstream involving the usage of 2 or more [trills](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Trill) occurring at the same time, though the trills may switch columns. They usually occur when chordstreams are quite dense with their chord usage and usually mix both one-handed and two-handed trills together.
