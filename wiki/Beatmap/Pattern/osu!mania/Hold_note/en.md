# Hold Note

Also referred to as holds in the editor, **hold notes** (long notes) are notes that require you to hold and release them afterwards. They are often referred to as long notes, noodles or LNs and are used to represent prolonged sounds in the music.

**Releases** refers to the ending of a **hold note**, the part that requires you to release the key. They are known to have their own term due to release timing in osu!mania being taken into consideration when awarding judgements for the entire hold note.

## Shield

**Shields** occur when a note is placed consecutively before a hold note in the same column. They play very similarly to [minijacks](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Jack#minijack).

**Reverse shields** occur when a consecutive note follows a hold note's release within the same column.

## Inverse

**Inverse** is a type of hold note pattern in which all the notes in each column are hold notes and after each release, another hold note follows in that column. This creates what looks like a wall of hold notes and forms dense patterning with heavier reliance on reading.
