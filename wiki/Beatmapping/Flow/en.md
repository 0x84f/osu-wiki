# Flow

The **flow** is a mapping concept that describes natural and intuitive movement of a player throughout the map. The flow, or lack thereof, is almost always related to the [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) game mode beatmaps due to the two-dimensional playfield. Additionally, the osu! beatmaps offer a vast variety of [patterns](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern) and slider shapes, which may be used by mappers to direct a player's cursor wherever they want to.

If a mapper deliberately ignores the concepts of flow, or uses their opposites, they utilise [antiflow](/wiki/Beatmapping/Antiflow).

## Key components

While flow is mostly subjective, as movement preferences differ from one person to another, there are a few ideas that give the feeling and impression of flow on a majority of patterns or whole beatmaps.

### Smooth movement

The cursor movement required to pass the map is stable most of the time and doesn't contain sharp, abrupt turns, or fast change of pace. Often, a player's cursor follows a smooth curve that spans for several patterns. The curve contains lots of circular or semicircular segments (so-called *oval or circular flow*) going in different directions, mixed with "neutral", non-demanding patterns. Such patterns don't contribute to the general direction, or only change it slightly to ease the transition to the next pattern.

Linear movement may also be considered another form of flow, albeit less common, since it doesn't enforce any specific cursor trajectory type.

### Repetition

Another kind of movement that feels natural is repetition. By clearing similar patterns that only differ slightly, such as back-and-forth [jumps](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/Jump) or a series of slider pairs, a player gets more comfortable with the map. This happens because every next movement follows an already familiar path and becomes easy to predict.

### Visual implications

To further make the beatmap look and feel more natural, mappers can use [streams](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/Stream) or sliders with the curves that follow the suggested movement direction. Since sliders' bodies may not be followed closely, as opposed to [slider ticks](/wiki/Beatmapping/Slider_tick), they may be adjusted and bent in lots of ways. This fact may be used both in favour of an already present movement trajectory, and to help the player pick up a new movement type section.
