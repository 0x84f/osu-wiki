# Flow

**Flow** is a mapping concept that describes natural and intuitive movement patterns of a player during gameplay. Flow, or the lack thereof, is almost always related to the [osu! game mode](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) due to the two-dimensional playfield. By utilising the vast variety of [patterns](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern) and slider shapes possible in osu! beatmaps, mappers are able to direct a player's cursor around the playfield in various ways, yielding different effects on the gameplay experience.

<!-- TODO: this applies to osu!catch as well, the article needs expansion: https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/7407#pullrequestreview-988657741 -->

Flow is considered a **subjective** and often an opinionated matter due to how different mappers and players design or perceive the movements. Some [input devices](/wiki/Gameplay/Input_device), such as [graphics tablet](/wiki/Gameplay/Input_device/Graphics_tablet), may reduce impact of the map's patterns on a player, while others (such as [mouse](/wiki/Gameplay/Input_device/Mouse)) amplify it.

The opposite of flow is called [antiflow](/wiki/Beatmapping/Antiflow), which conversely involves unintuitive or unnatural movement patterns.

## Key components

While movement preferences vary from one person to another, there are a few ideas that give the feeling and impression of flow on a majority of patterns or whole beatmaps.

### Smooth movement

The cursor movement required to pass the map is stable most of the time and doesn't contain sharp, abrupt turns, or fast change of pace. Often, a player's cursor follows a smooth curve that spans for several patterns. The curve contains lots of circular[^circular-flow] or semicircular segments (so-called *oval* or *circular flow*) going in different directions, mixed with "neutral", non-demanding patterns. Such patterns don't contribute to the general direction, or only change it slightly to ease the transition to the next pattern.

Linear movement may also be considered another form of smooth flow, albeit less common, since it doesn't enforce any specific cursor trajectory type.

### Repetition

Another kind of movement that feels natural is repetition. By clearing similar patterns that only differ slightly, such as back-and-forth [jumps](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/Jump) or a series of slider pairs, a player gets more comfortable with the map. This happens because every next movement follows an already familiar path and becomes easy to predict.

### Visual implications

To further make the beatmap look and feel more natural, mappers can use [streams](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/Stream) or sliders with the curves that follow the suggested movement direction. Since sliders' bodies may not be followed closely, as opposed to [slider ticks](/wiki/Beatmapping/Slider_tick), they may be adjusted and bent in lots of ways. This fact may be used both in favour of an already present movement trajectory, and to help the player pick up a new movement type section.

## Notes

[^circular-flow]: At the same time, circular movement applied in the same direction for too long is viewed as both too repetitive and uncomfortable due to mouse drift<!-- TODO: link -->.
