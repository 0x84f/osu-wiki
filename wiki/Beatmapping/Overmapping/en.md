# Overmapping

In beatmapping, **overmapping** is a technique where [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) are deliberately placed in a way that creates a higher gameplay intensity compared to what the song (or the rest of the map) conceivably calls for.

This is mainly done by mapping to inaudible or non-existant sounds (e.g. adding notes on blue ticks when the song has sounds only on red ticks). Less frequently, overmapping can also be achieved by adding exorbitantly large [jumps](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!/Jump) or sliders with very high [slider velocity](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Slider_velocity).

## Examples

Please note that while overmapping is generally discouraged, this technique remains perfectly acceptable to use when applied under an appropriate context.
