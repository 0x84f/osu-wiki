# Discord servers

As the community grows and expands, several [Discord](https://discord.com/) servers have been made and maintained by the community to specialize in the game's many different facets.

Each server provides a space with a specific purpose in mind, where players get together to discuss and work on various different projects. This index aims to serve as an index where users can find a subcommunity they can best fit in.

## osu! Development server

The **osu! Development** server — also known as **osu!dev** or just **osu!** — is the game's official Discord server. It is meant to be the main place to view and discuss osu!'s ongoing developments, a place to contribute to the codebase, and a place where a plethora of community projects are organised in!

**This is the only server officially affiliated with the game.** To keep up with osu!'s active development, it is strongly suggested to join the server.
