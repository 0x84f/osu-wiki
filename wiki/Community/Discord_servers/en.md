# Discord servers

As the community grows and expands, several [Discord](https://discord.com/) servers have been made and maintained by the community to specialize in the game's many different facets.

Each server provides a space with a specific purpose in mind, where players get together to discuss and work on various different projects. This index aims to serve as an index where users can find a subcommunity they can best fit in.

## Community

These are servers made by the community, for the community. They do not have a specific purpose. However, they serve as community hubs for users to interact in and be up to date with different aspects of the game.

| [osu!](https://discord.gg/ppy) | [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) | The **osu!** Discord server, previously known as **osu!dev**, is osu!'s official Discord server for development-related purposes. The server functions as a hub for people to discuss and work on osu!'s open source and community projects. This is the main place to contribute to osu!'s development and get in touch with the osu! team.  |

### Project Loved

<!-- This section as a whole needs to be discussed. Last time someone suggested listing the Loved suite of servers in the Project Loved wiki article, not everyone was on board. Moreover, some of its members and pepy themselves are not really happy on how everything is split apart. Question is whether we want to promote these servers while they exist, or ignore them in favour of the #osu-loved channel in the dev server -->

[Project Loved](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved/) organizes its workflows in different servers, divided by the ruleset which they specialize in. Moreover, the official osu! Discord server provides the `#osu-loved` for the community to discuss about the project as a whole.

## Development

These servers focus on providing and developing tools and systems for the game. While the official development of osu! is done in the official community Discord server, certain projects require their own workspaces before proposing and merging their work in game.

**The following servers are not officially affiliated with the game.** To follow up with official updates, join the [osu!](https://discord.gg/ppy) Discord server instead.

## Mapping and Modding

Quite a self-descriptive category. These servers aim to provide safe places for both mappers and modders alike. Users can expect to find a trove of both mapping and modding knowledge in these for their respective modes!
