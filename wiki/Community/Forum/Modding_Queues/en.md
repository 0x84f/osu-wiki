# Modding Queues

<!-- TODO: this needs to be linked from other related articles, for example, "how to get mods" -->

[**Modding Queues**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60) is a forum dedicated to [beatmap review](/wiki/Modding) requests, or mods. It consists of forum threads, or *queues* belonging to different modders and mappers. Every queue has individual requirements and limits on obtaining the mods, which must be respected by its visitors in order to receive a mod.

## Queue rounds

Before the start of every round, the queue's owner posts a short announcement, which typically contains:

- The number of maps that may be accepted in this round
- Requirements specific to this round
- Whether the mods are regular (normal), or [a mod in return](/wiki/Modding/Mod_for_mod) is expected
- Other information relevant to modding

After enough requests are left in the thread, the modder posts a short message saying which beatmaps were accepted for modding. After that, the queue is said to be closed until the next round.
