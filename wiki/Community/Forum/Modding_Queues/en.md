# Modding Queues

<!-- TODO: this needs to be linked from other related articles, for example, "how to get mods" -->

[**Modding Queues**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60) is a forum dedicated to [beatmap review](/wiki/Modding) requests, or mods. It consists of forum threads, or *queues* belonging to different modders and mappers. Every queue has individual requirements and limits on obtaining the mods, which must be respected by its visitors in order to receive a mod.

Since 2011-11-30,<!-- TODO: add https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues/8256 as a footnote when they're supported --> each game mode has its own subforum for queues, with osu! taking up main section of the forum:

- [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60)
- [osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/121)
- [osu!catch](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/122)
- [osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/123)

## Queue rounds

To keep their workload at appropriate level, most modders only accept requests during short periods called rounds. Before the start of every round, the queue's owner posts a short announcement, which typically contains:

- The number of maps that may be accepted in this round
- Requirements specific to this round
- Whether the mods are regular (normal), or [a mod in return](/wiki/Modding/Mod_for_mod) is expected
- Other information relevant to modding

Once enough requests are left in the thread, the modder will post a short message saying which beatmaps were accepted for modding. After that, the queue is said to be closed until the next round, while its owner mods the requested maps.
