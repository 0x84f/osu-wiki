# Off-Topic

<!-- TODO: A LOT could be written here: https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/issues/2804 -->

[**Off-Topic**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/52) is a forum meant for the community to have conversations without particular focus in topic. Threads can often be random, change topic, and/or have multiple topics simultaneously. Topics can range anything from daily life, opinions about the game, role play, jokes and meta content, nonsense, or anything in between.
