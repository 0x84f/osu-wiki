# Project Loved

**Project Loved** is the voting platform that promotes beatmaps to the [Loved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved) category. It is run primarily by the [Project Loved Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Project_Loved_Team).

## Moving a beatmap to Loved

Beatmaps are moved to Loved by a nomination and voting process.

Members of the Project Loved Team called **captains** regularly nominate beatmaps for a specific game mode. These sets almost always come from submissions from the osu! community.

To submit a beatmap for Loved, please visit the [beatmap submission page](https://loved.sh/submit) of the Project Loved website and fill out the form. Upon submitting, you will be able to view your submission under the listing of its respective game mode along with the others. Below are the listings where these submissions can be viewed:

- [osu! submissions](https://loved.sh/submissions/osu)
- [osu!taiko submissions](https://loved.sh/submissions/taiko)
- [osu!catch submissions](https://loved.sh/submissions/fruits)
- [osu!mania submissions](https://loved.sh/submissions/mania)

Nominated mapsets are then posted to the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120), where community members may vote whether they want the mapset to be Loved or not. Maps reaching a specified threshold percentage of "Yes" votes at their polls' end time will be moved to the Loved category.

## Eligibility

There are some very minimal criteria that need to be met for beatmaps to be nominated for Loved. Each game mode has its own specific criteria for Loved beatmap nomination and priority, but all modes follow these rules:

- It is not in the Qualified, Ranked or Approved categories
- Its creator does not disapprove of it being Loved
- Its creator is neither banned nor restricted
- At least one difficulty can be passed

Although many Pending and Work-in-progress maps meet these criteria, few are voted into the Loved category due to the more selective nomination and voting requirements.

Beatmaps entering the Loved category are required to follow some additional rulesets:

- [Some points from the Metadata section of the ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#metadata):
  - Song title, artist, and source should be correct in all cases.
  - Beatmap tags should properly list all contributors (guest difficulty creators, storyboarders, etc.).
- [Song Content Rules](/wiki/Rules/Song_Content_Rules)
- [Visual Content Considerations](/wiki/Rules/Visual_Content_Considerations)

Additionally, in order to keep the audio quality of the song at a reasonable level, beatmap audio files should have an average bitrate of at least 128kbps.

Any problems with these rules are usually sorted out while the map is up for voting.

## osu!-specific criteria

Starting from February 2023, beatmaps of the osu! game mode considered for Loved will follow the **categorisation rules** and the **basic Loved requirements**, a set of guidelines similar to the ranking criteria, adapted for the more lenient process Project Loved is known for.

### Categorisation

Every month, beatmaps are chosen according to 9 categories, with the goal of ensuring variety for every selection of maps by the Captains.

- **Popular Playcounts:** Beatmaps that have reached a very high amount of popularity in the community, having at least 100,000 playcount.
- **Outstanding Oldies:** Beatmaps that have been submitted more than six years before their Loved nomination date.
- **Small Spectacules:** Beatmaps that are deemed outstanding by the captains, yet do not have a huge following, having less than 5,000 playcount.
- **Daredevil Difficulties:** Beatmaps that are known for their extreme difficulty, nominated with the prime goal of allowing top player competition.
- **Ranked Rejects:** Beatmaps with full difficulty spreads that have been popular for a long time, yet never reached Ranked status.
- **Gameplay Gimmicks:** Beatmaps that apply gameplay gimmicks in unconventional ways, such as Aspire, storyboard based maps, and other edge cases.
- **Meme Monstrosities:** Beatmaps that are popular due to their humorous content, as well as maps that focus on local communities' subcultures.
- **Second Shots:** Beatmaps that have been rejected in past Loved votings which receive a second chance.
- **Chill Champions:** Beatmaps that are casual-friendly, not having a difficulty over 5\*.

Additionally, up to three wildcard beatmaps may be chosen from any category, adding to a total of twelve maps per month. For any questions regarding what goes in each category, contact the osu! Loved captains.

### Basic Loved Requirements

#### Preface

- **Following all of the rules and guidelines below do not guarantee your map will be chosen for Loved.** They are there to define a minimum threshold all beatmaps in the Loved section should follow. Being bothersome to Captains repeatedly or causing havoc around the community to try and force your way into Loved are seen as negative traits that will harm your beatmap more than help. Beatmaps are chosen through a nomination process that is mainly guided by the beatmap's stats, but also involves the opinions of the Captains. There is no "automatic system" in place.
- The creation of this document and these rules applies retroactively to every map that is not Loved.
- If you need help with any of the more technical requirements, don't hesitate to contact a Loved Captain for guidance. You may also join the osu!dev Discord and ask for help in the #osu-loved channel.

#### Rules

- **All rules are exactly that: rules.** They are not guidelines and may not be broken under any circumstance.
- **The beatmap must abide by the Beatmap Submission Rules.** This includes all there is to be said about explicit content, permissions on song usage and copying sections of beatmaps without permission.
- **The beatmap must abide by the [beatmap submission rules](/wiki/Rules#beatmap-submission-rules).** This includes all there is to be said about explicit content, permissions on song usage and copying sections of beatmaps without permission.
- **The beatmap must not be currently in the Qualified, Ranked or Approved categories.** Ideally, a map should not be going for Ranked and Loved at the same time, as they are mutually exclusive.
- **The beatmap be at least one year 1 year old since the submission date to the nomination date.** This rule does not apply to mapsets that completely break the ranking criteria at their concept (Sliderator usage, Aspire maps, storyboard maps). This makes sure that the mappers do not submit a map directly for Loved when Ranked might be a better option. It **still applies** to beatmaps without a full difficulty spread or maps with extreme difficulty if they do not contain the exceptions above.
- **The beatmap must have at least 30 favourites.** This is a minimum threshold so that there is some sort of indication that there is a positive (and existing) community reaction to the beatmap. Brigading for favourites is also discouraged, although Captains cannot verify whether that happens. The goal is for the map to have a natural reception from the community.
- **Every person involved in the mapset must not disapprove of it being Loved.** This includes guest difficulty creators, hitsounders, skinners and storyboarders. Users who are inactive for over a year, haven't expressed disapproval of the nomination of the map and are unreachable through osu! private messages do not need to be contacted.
- **The beatmap creator cannot be either banned or restricted.** Guest difficulties from restricted users will be judged on a case-by-case basis once the map is considered for nomination by a Loved Captain.
- **At least one difficulty of the mapset relevant in the Loved submission process does not autofail.** This ensures that no beatmaps with broken score submission, such as some Aspire maps, enter the Loved section, as it would be pointless to give them a leaderboard. This also forbids mapsets that are relevant solely because of an unpassable difficulty, even if they have other difficulties, as it also goes against the very purpose of giving the maps leaderboards. If the mapset has a difficulty that auto-fails, a new difficulty that removes the problematic objects needs to be also included in the mapset, preferably removing the original.
- **Every difficulty of a beatmap must have a minimum drain time of 20 seconds.** This is lower than the 30 second minimum of the ranking criteria to be less limiting, however anything less than 20 seconds is nearly impossible to provide a quality gameplay experience. Single soundbites do not represent what could be an actual "song", and do not work well with leaderboards due to their short length.
- **A beatmap must have at least some form of mapping contribution from the person submitting it.** This is to avoid "map compilations" which, even with the original mappers' permissions, do not represent the kind of original work we would like to showcase on the Loved section.
- **Beatmaps must be timed in a way that does not impact gameplay negatively at any point in the beatmap.** Differently than the ranking criteria, which requires near-millisecond accurate timing for all beatmaps, some songs may have timing that is too complex. If you are unsure whether your timing for a submitted Loved map is correct, contact one of the osu! Loved Captains for help.
- **Beatmaps that have their concept based around their storyboard must not be easily abusable by players through file editing.** This is so the leaderboards for these maps stay fair to players who are playing the map as intended. A few recommendations are changing the Approach Rate to 0, making invisible notes' timing windows more natural to the player, and using the .osu difficulty-specific storyboarding instead of the .osb file. These might not apply to every map, so nominated maps will be judged on a case-by-case basis.

#### Guidelines

- **Guidelines may be ignored under exceptional circumstances.** These exceptional circumstances can be justified by an explanation as of why the guideline has been ignored and why not ignoring it will interfere with the overall quality of the creation.
- **All of the rules and guidelines in the ranking criteria that are not explicitly mentioned as rules in this document still apply as guidelines.** Some of them may be enforced depending on an individual case-by-case basis, although this will only happen during the Nomination process of a beatmap and the mapper will be contacted if any changes are needed. It is important to highlight that full difficulty spreads are not required for Loved eligibility, except for the Ranked Reject category.
- **Brigading the beatmap in the Loved website is extremely discouraged.** Asking other users to give positive reviews on your map goes against the very purpose of a beatmap that has naturally garnered the community's attention. This situation only skews the beatmap's ratings on the osu! website and otherwise do not help the map gain any priority in the nomination process by the Captains. Remember, anyone can notice unnatural activity in the reviews section that does not match the map's stats.
- **Metadata for a beatmap should be as accurate as possible.** Beatmaps that are nominated for Loved voting go through a final metadata check by specialised members of the community. However, while your map is still in the Loved website listing, make sure you are not purposefully mislabeling an artist or a song. This makes it easier for users to search for your beatmap when looking for the song. When in doubt, you can contact a Loved captain on what could be the best option for your map's metadata for the time being.
- **Uninherited timing points should be the same in every difficulty of a beatmap.** Each point should have the same BPM and offset in each difficulty. This may be ignored where uninherited timing points are used for a certain gimmick involving changing BPM, slider velocity or other factors that don't happen in every difficulty.
- **All the difficulties in the beatmap should be finished.** By finished, it is defined as reaching the start and end point of the song, excluding unmappable sections, intros or outros. For example, in a 5-minute song with multiple difficulties, if your Extra and Hard are 4:30 minutes long, your Insane cannot be 1 minute long. If all of the difficulties have a large amount of the song left unmapped, the mp3 should be cut accordingly.

### Nomination priority

There are no strict rules governing which maps a captain must nominate for Loved, but generally the nominated maps are very well known and appreciated by the community (as the title "Loved" implies). Sometimes a mapset will also be preferred if it is significantly older than others or contains beatmaps with unique and high-quality mapping styles.
