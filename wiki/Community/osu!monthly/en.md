# osu!monthly

The **osu!monthly** is a self-generated project by members of the community, grouped under the name of the [osu!monthly Team](/wiki/People/osu!monthly_Team), to create a monthly newspaper that summarizes the news of osu!. Although there have been many different versions of this one, the project has always been the same and will remain so in the future: monthly summary of what's happening on osu! (and more precisely in the community).

## Becoming an osu!monthly contributor

The osu!monthly is a community effort project with people within the community contributing its making, therefore, anyone that wants to help contributing, such as to write, share your opinions and thoughts, or just to give any kind of feedback are pretty much welcomed! However, only the most regular people can really be considered as part of the [osu!monthly Team](/wiki/People/osu!monthly_Team/).

To start, join the [osu!dev Discord server](/wiki/Community/osu%21dev_Discord_server) and verify yourself with the intention to help with the progress of osu!monthly. After you got verified, head over to the #osu-news channel on the bottom and start discussing your idea with the people alike!

Or if you're not feeling to do any of that, feel free to reach out to 0x84f#0001 in Discord, the lead of the project.

## History and Archives

Below you will find the archive of all iterations of osu!monthly as well as information on the development of osu!monthly over time.

### The beginnings (2011)

The original run of osu!monthly created by [jjrocks](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30985), [Corin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/639270), and friends ran from March 2011 to October 2011. The magazine was then released in a `.pdf` format with all the most important information about the osu! community.

### The resurection (2017-2018)

Inspired by the first version of the osu!monthly, a new team was formed thanks to [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) and [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350) and new iterations of the monthly could be published from October 2017 to February 2018. The format was still `.pdf` at the time, but with a more consistent and pleasing design.

### A new beginning (2022 - now)

With a desire to once again revive this project, the [osu!monthly Team](/wiki/People/osu!monthly_Team/) was formed with [0x84f](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724) at the helm, and relaunched the project this time directly as newsposts, and not by `.pdf`. The project continues to perpetuate, and hopefully for a long time.
