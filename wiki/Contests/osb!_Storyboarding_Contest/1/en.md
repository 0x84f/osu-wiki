## Ruleset

### General rules

- **You can choose any song, theme and sprites (including your own)**. This is so that we do not limit your potential and idea.
- **Mapping is not required**. This is a storyboarding contest!
- Use of **provided sprites are optional**, but it is **strongly encouraged since points are calculated with sprites and their usage**.
- If you get a **name change** during the duration of the tournament, please **let hosts know as soon as possible**!
- **No previous experience necessary**. (This includes osu!editor’s design tab, programming and photoshop, but would be a great advantage)
- Prizes are distributed in the span of 2 weeks after results have been released.

### Submission rules

- **This contest will be individual only**. This means storyboard collaboration is prohibited.
- If you want to use illustration from an artist, **think about permission / cite them accordingly**.
- If you want to use sprites from another storyboard(s), **do not use them until you have permission from the storyboarder(s)**.
- Regarding how much you can edit and still be counted as part of sprite from our sprite pool, please refer to image here.

![](img/editing-rules.jpg "Contest editing rules")

- **Do not share storyboards, code, and/or sprites when you’re done!** (This includes screenshots and/or gifs of the storyboard) Sharing them will put you in a disadvantage!
- You can get hints on making specific effects you have in mind, but **do not ask others to make an effect for you!**
- **If you already have WIP storyboard, you may use it in this contest.** However, we would like to see the SB that you submit to us being used in beatmap as well without having big modifications.
