## Rules

- **Submission must include the following:**
  - A beatmap spread of *cYsmix - triangles* with 5 difficulties total: Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, and Expert.
- **Submission must include the following:**
  - A beatmap spread of *cYsmix - triangles* with **FIVE DIFFICULTIES TOTAL**: Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, and Expert. [Download the beatmap template here!](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/2/Songs/cYsmix%20-%20triangles.osz)
  - A storyboard with a `.osb` file no greater than **1 MB**. This is to ensure the storyboard is well optimised and doesn't take too long to parse and load into the game.
- **Submission must be no greater than 10 MB.** While not required, we recommend designs that use simple shapes, keep resources to a minimum, and align with lazer's approach to UI design.
- **Submission must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Beatmaps must be in *osu!* game mode only.** Comparing beatmaps of different modes in a judging scenario is unfortunately not realistic.
- **Beatmaps should abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be disqualified.
- **Team name and members must be confirmed through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeExd07kLYqp-Mx-lM7Wwxii_qidSUasAlMi3HUHUsdfVSUyg/viewform?usp=sf_link).**
  - If your country does not support Google Forms, [send pishifat a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418).
  - Teams must have 2-5 members.
- **Submissions must not be publicly revealed until after the judging phase ends.**
- **Submissions must not be Qualified until after the community vote ends.**
