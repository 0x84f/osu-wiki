# Daily Challenge

The **daily challenge** is a multiplayer mode in osu!(lazer) where the main task is to pass a selected beatmap that changes everyday sometimes with specific [mods](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier).

## How to play

*Notice: Daily challenge requires an [osu! account](/wiki/Registration), and is not available for [silenced](/wiki/Silence) players.*

From the main menu, the daily challenge menu can be accessed with the following steps:

1. Click the `Play` button or press `P`.
2. Click the `Daily challenge` button or press `D`.

## Main Menu

On entering, the user is presented with an intro showing the beatmap the user has to pass, and the mods they have to pass it with.
After the intro ends, the user can view the data for today's challenge. The left side displays various score-related information like the total pass count and the cumulative total score. In the middle, a leaderboard shows the top scores achieved by players. Users are able to discuss the daily challenge in the chat on the right.

## Selected Beatmaps

Each day will introduce one new map from the [featured artist](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists) listing with increased difficulty. Regularly after one week however, the difficulty would be reset again.

Sometimes, the maps could come with a mod forced onto users, which required them to pass the map with the selected mod.

## Trivia

### History

::: Infobox
![](img/yt_comment.jpg "waxxx14's comment suggesting to make a cup of the day format that can be found in")
:::

- The idea for daily challenge was taken from a comment from waxxx14 requesting a "cup of the day" format from [trackmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrackMania) in osu!, under a lazer dev video, ["deciding what to do with lazer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUSxEjQQ1UI)

- The daily challenge launched to the public on July 25, 2024 in osu!(lazer) public relase 2024.725.0.

- In the initial release, free mods were not selectable, and the total pass count as well as the cumulative total score were only added in a later update.
