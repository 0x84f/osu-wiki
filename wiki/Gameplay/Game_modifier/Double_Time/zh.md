## 说明

*Note: The method used to increase the speed does not increase the pitch of the song.*

The **Double Time** [游戏模组](/wiki/Game_modifier) that attempts to increase the difficulty of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) by increasing their overall speed (BPM) by 150% (1.5x), reducing the length of the song by 33%, and increasing the [approach rate (AR)](/wiki/Beatmapping/Approach_rate), [overall difficulty (OD)](/wiki/Beatmapping/Overall_difficulty), and [health (HP)](/wiki/Gameplay/Health).

The Double Time mod is widely regarded as one of the best mods used for gaining large amounts of [performance points](/wiki/Performance_points) on easier difficulties in [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!).

### osu!taiko

In [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko), the hit leniency is greatly reduced when the Double Time mod is enabled due to osu!taiko's already strict overall difficulty along with its considerably more difficult-to-hit slider ticks. Because of this, the Double Time mod is widely regarded as the hardest mod in osu!taiko and is seldom used.

### osu!catch

In [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch), there is no overall difficulty to increase. Thus this mod only increases the BPM and AR. As a result, it is only worth a 1.06x multiplier (as opposed to 1.12x multiplier for every other mod).

Although this mod does greatly increase the hyperdash leniency, making fruits require hyperdashes that are near impossible to catch in some cases.

## 杂项

- When the Double Time mod is enabled, the `Length`, `BPM`, and `Objects` values are coloured in a light red with the new values. (Pictured below.)
  - The `Objects` value is coloured a light red even though no change in value is actually made.
- The `AR`, `OD`, and `HP` values will have a superscript triangle next to their values indicate a small increase in their values. (Pictured below.)
- The name "Double Time" could be labelled as a misnomer, as the DT mod does not actually increase the speed of a beatmap by two times (200%); it speeds up beatmaps by 1.5x (150%).
