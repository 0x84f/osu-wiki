# Hit circle

*Hit circles* are colored, circular [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) present in [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) and [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). Their appearance varies between each game mode but will generally require a player to click on/tap the hit circle in time with the beat to earn [score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score) based on how [accurate](/wiki/Gameplay/Accuracy) they were (e.g. if they clicked too early, their points would be reduced). Tapping hit circles gives a very small boost to the [health bar](/wiki/Client/Interface/Health_bar), alongside a bigger boost at the end of a [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo).

In osu!, hit circles appear with a number on top; showing their place in a combo. Hit circles are also outlined with [approach circles](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Approach_circle), which shrink around them. Once the approach circle overlaps the hit circle, the player should click on/tap the hit circle to earn score.

In osu!taiko, hit circles appear from right-to-left as either red or blue notes (Don or Katu). As hit circles approach and line up with the white [judgement](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement) circle the correct key(s) must be pressed to gain score.
