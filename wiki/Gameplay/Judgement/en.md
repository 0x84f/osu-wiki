# Judgement

<!-- TODO (cleanup tasks): this is missing a lead section, and the article itself may probably be simplified -->

## osu!

**Hit circles:**

- A 300, 100 or 50 given from a normal hit circle depending on how accurately the player tap on it.
- A miss given if the player do not click on the hit circle at all or click on it way too early.

**Sliders:**

- The judgement for sliders does not depend on the accuracy of the initial hit.
- Sliders consist of slider ticks, which include the start, end and repeat points of the slider.
- A 300 given if the player successfully gets all slider ticks, a 100 given if the player gets at least half of them, and a 50 given if the player manages to collect even one of the ticks.
- Tapping a slider **too early** does not incur a miss but will **reset** the score multiplier to **0**.
  - Not collecting the slider ticks, shown or otherwise, will not incur a miss, but will **reset** the score multiplier to **0**.
  - Missing the slider end does not incur a miss but will **not** increment the score multiplier.
- A miss given if the player collects none of the slider ticks.

**Spinner:**

- A 300, 100 or 50 given depending on the number of spins done compared to the length of the spinner.
- A miss if the player unable to expand the spinner circle to a satisfactory limit for a 50 to be given.
  - v1 skin behaviour: A miss if the player unable to fill the meter shown on both sides of the spinner to a satisfactory limit for a 50 to be given.

**Small/Large Notes:**

- *GREAT* given if drummed inside the judgement circle perfectly with correct colour.
- *GOOD* given if drummed slightly away from the judgement circle with correct colour.
- *MISS/BAD* given if drummed too early, too late, missed the judgement circle, or drummed the wrong colour.

**Drumroll:**

- Constant 300/600 score with Kiai Time bonus when available given per small notes drummed successfully in the drumroll with any colour.
- No score given when drummed on the gap of the small notes.
- No *MISS/BAD* for not doing the drumroll as per *Taiko no Tatsujin* style.

**Denden/Shaker:**

- Constant 300 score given per hit/shake until completed.
- *GREAT* given on the last hit/shake.

**Notes:**

- MAX (rainbow 300), 300, 200, 100 or 50 from a note depending on timing of hit.
- A Miss given when missing a note or hit it way too early.

**Hold notes:**

- The judgement for hold notes depends on both starting hold and ending release points.
- Keep holding till end of note, with initial and final with perfect timing: MAX
- Keep holding till end of note, without releasing the note: 200
- Do a *NG* and not recover the hold note: Miss
- Do a *NG* and even hold back the note: 50

NG: *Not Good*, a term in *StepMania/DDR*, which happens when the hold note was released during hold timing.
