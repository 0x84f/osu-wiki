osu!catch is different from the other game modes in that there is no concept of timing or hit windows.

| Image | Name | [Hit value](/wiki/Gameplay/Score/ScoreV1/osu!catch) |
| :-: | :-: | --: |
| ![](img/catch-300.png) | Fruit | 300 |
| ![](img/catch-100.png) | Drop | 30 |
| ![](img/catch-50.png) | Droplet | 10 |

## Judgement mechanics

- Accuracy in osu!catch is calculated as the ratio of fruits, drops, and droplets caught.
- Fruits and drops increase combo and cause misses, while droplets and bananas have no effect.
