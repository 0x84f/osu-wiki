- History  (6 October 2007 â€“ 24 July 2012)

Prior to [ppv1](/wiki/Performance_points/ppv1) and [ppv2](/wiki/Performance_points/ppv2), a player's rank was determined by the amount of ranked score the player had. thus resulting in frequent #1 changes due to how small osu! was at the time and the lack of maps. Ranked score was fully replaced by ppv1 as of July 24, 2012, which was later to be replaced by ppv2 on January 27, 2014.

## Approved beatmaps

Approved was a category for beatmaps that awarded a huge amount of score or maps that were too difficult to be ranked (e.g.,
[marathons](/wiki/Beatmap/Marathon) Approved beatmaps formerly did not award ranked score, but instead awarded [total score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score/Total_score) and pp. In contrast, "loved maps" do not award pp but do award both ranked and total score.
