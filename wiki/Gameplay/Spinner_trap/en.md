# Spinner Trap

A term used in [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) when the [fruit](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit) after a [spinner](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Spinner) is not easily accessible naturally. Several ways can cause this:

- The follow-up fruit is on the outer edges of the playfield.
- The follow-up fruit is placed at an unreachable distance from the last banana in the optimal spin path.
- The follow-up fruit being obfuscated by [bananas](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Banana).
