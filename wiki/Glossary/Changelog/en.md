The changelog has been started by peppy on 11th of September, 2007 in a dedicated forum thread titled "[Official Development Changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/15)", where he would list notable changes and bug fixes, and sometimes share insights on upcoming plans. In October, 2007, a web version of changelog [became available](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/2499), both through the website and the osu! updater.

On 25th of October, 2009, the changelog [became available via the RSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/19137) feed.

On 28th of October, 2015, a graph with osu! versions distribution across the playerbase [was added to the changelog](https://web.archive.org/web/20151103161516/http://osu.ppy.sh:80/p/changelog), making the statistics open to the general public. At the same time, it became possible to filter changelog by update stream.
