# Choke

A term used when a player almost obtains a full combo while playing a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap), but [breaks the combo](/wiki/Glossary/Combobreak) near the end. On the contrary, a **reverse choke** is when a player breaks the combo at the beginning, but holds it throughout the rest of the beatmap. In [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) and [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch), which put emphasis on maintaining the combo, the difference in [total score](/wiki/Score) between regular and reverse chokes may be drastic, as late misses cause a player to potentially lose more score.

The term is also used by many other online communities to describe the same or similar events and actions. (E.g., *Super Smash Bros.* and *speedrunners*)

## Causes of choke

The key characteristic of a choke is its randomness and inconsistent performance. This excludes regular or pattern-specific misses or [slider breaks](/wiki/Gameplay/Sliderbreak), which are usually tied to a player's level of skill, or a beatmap's design. Chokes are typically caused by excessive mental stress and nervousness during gameplay, as well as overall fatigue.
