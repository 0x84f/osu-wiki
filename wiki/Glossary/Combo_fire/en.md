**Combo fire** was a background gameplay element that originated from the [Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!](/wiki/iNiS_games) DS Game that eventually got integrated into osu!. This would display a burning, yellow flame after obtaining the first [combo milestone](/wiki/Glossary/Combo_milestone). If the player obtained a [combo](/wiki/Glossary/Combo_(score_multiplier)) of 500x, the combo fire would change colour from yellow to blue. The fire would extinguish if the combo was broken, but would be reobtainable if combo was regained.

Combo fire was disabled on March 5, 2013 due to performance concerns.
