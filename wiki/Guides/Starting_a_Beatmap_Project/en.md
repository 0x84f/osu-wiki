# How to start a beatmap project

*Notice: This article is about the [Beatmap Projects](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/53) forum section and how to approach it. Make sure to read its [forum rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/453937) before posting.*

## Making an informative thread title

*Yes, your thread's title will determine if other osu! users will "yay" or "nay" your Beatmap Project, even before they click on it!*

This should consist `[Discography]` / `[Album]` / `[Collab]` before the title. Chances are high that your project will be ignored or moved to [AW](/wiki/Abandoned_wasteland) if the thread's title lacks on informations.

Good examples:

- `[Album] Pandora Voxx -complete-`
- `[Discography] Deemo`

Bad examples:

- `starting a new project, need your help with this album`

### Which one do I use?

**Discography:** List of albums/songs released by the singer/group/composer/game overall.

Example:

- [Duca](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/98205)
- [Linkin Park](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/121592)
- [Cytus](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/177446)

**Album:** List of songs in the album.

Example:

- [Anamanaguchi - Scott Pilgrim vs The World (The Game)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/37908)
- [Daft Punk - Random Access Memories](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/132592)

**Collab:** Creating a [group-mapping project](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_collaborations) for a certain song. May range from [storyboard](/wiki/Storyboard) request to mapping parts of a [marathon map](/wiki/Beatmap/Marathon). [Reference](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/35841)

Example:

- [Within Temptation - The Unforgiving](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/29157)
