# 토너먼트 밴

*Main page: [Help centre](/wiki/Help_centre)*

토너먼트 밴은 플레이어가 어떤 자격으로든 공식적으로 지원되는 토너먼트에 참여하는 것을 금지시킵니다. 여기에는 플레이어 및 스태프와 기타 모든 대회 관련 지원이 포함됩니다.

토너먼트 밴은 직접 받는 경우가 매우 드물지만, 일반적으로 [계정 제한](/wiki/Help_centre/Account_restrictions)에 대한 항소로 제한이 풀린 대부분의 플레이어는 최소 1년의 토너먼트 밴이 적용됩니다.

큰 상품이 걸려있는 토너먼트 특성상 토너먼트 밴은 매우 심각하게 다루며, 일반적인 계정 제한처럼 관대하게 받아들여지지 않습니다.

## 토너먼트 밴을 받는 원인은 무엇인가요? {#why-temporary}
[공식적으로 지원받는 토너먼트](/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support)중에 발생하는 심각한 [커뮤니티 규칙](/wiki/Rules) 위반은 대회 플레이 중에 발생한 것이 아니여도 토너먼트 밴을 초래할 수 있습니다.

As a real-world example, such behaviour would include drawing or writing hate symbols/slurs (swastika, etc.) using cursor smoke in streamed matches.

All users returning to the game after a restriction under the standard appeal terms are also subject to a [minimum temporary tournament ban of 1 year](/wiki/Help_centre/Account_restrictions#reasons), which may be lengthened at the discretion of the [account support team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Account_support_team).

## What causes someone to receive a permanent tournament ban? {#why-permanent}

Any use of third-party cheating tools or other methods to gain an unfair advantage over other participants in an officially supported tournament will result in a permanent tournament ban. In some situations, especially excessive cases of abuse may also elicit such a punishment.

This includes situations like:

- As above, any use of third-party cheating tools or utilities to gain an advantage
- Making use of multiple accounts to enter a tournament
- Attempting to evade a silence or infringement by using another account
- Account sharing within/during an officially supported tournament
- Conspiring to obtain or otherwise using private information to gain or confer an advantage (such as accessing mappool information before other teams, etc.)
- Abusing positions of trust to gain or confer an advantage (manipulating schedules, unfairly changing team compositions, or disqualifying participants without cause or reasoning)
- Organising targeted abuse campaigns towards participants or organisers well outside the realm of criticism

## Can I appeal a tournament ban? {#appeal}

Whether temporary or permanent, **tournament bans cannot be appealed**.

In rare situations, the [account support team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Account_support_team) may review individual cases at their discretion and remove or reapply appropriate punishments to ensure they remain consistent with similar instances in the past.

## What can I do while tournament-banned? {#while-banned}

You may continue to play in community tournaments that do not request official support or require screening at the discretion of the individuals organising such events.

Information about your tournament ban status may be provided to tournament organisers upon request, whether they are benefitting from official support or not.
