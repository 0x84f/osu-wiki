# History of osu! 2010

## January

The [Wai-con](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wai-Con) anime convention in Perth had osu!arcade, a fully self-contained arcade machine running a touch-based version of osu!. Although playing too much on it could lead to sore fingers as some people had criticised, the prototype containing custom-made hardware and a built-in touchscreen was well-received by the community.[^wai-con]

## February

A new osu! update made small improvements in the overall user interface and added the ability to move all storyboard events by an arbitrary time value, allowing for more fine-tuned storyboard animations. In addition to this, usernames became clickable in chat logs.[^stable-b1460]

## March

Through February to March, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) organised an art competition dedicated to banners for in-game challenges, with the prize being the art's official recognition and a year of [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter) or physical goods. After a [community voting](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/27112?n=1) round, the osu! team made the final choice.[^art-challenge]

On March 8, an osu! update brought mainly performance and audio improvements to the game.[^stable-b1485]

## April

Due to infrastructure changes, the [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) server was moved to the address `irc.ppy.sh`.[^irc]

This month, peppy introduced a new star rating difficulty algorithm in an osu! update.[^stable-b1596]

## August

On August 2, all users were granted a single username change. To change username, they had to have received an osu!supporter tag at least once, either through purchase or as a gift.[^name-change]

The [`!report`](/wiki/BanchoBot#report) chat command was added to [Bancho](/wiki/BanchoBot), which allowed people to notify chat moderators about users misbehaving in the chat.[^bancho-report]

[nardii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1017) gave peppy access to their [Twitter](https://twitter.com) account [@osugame](https://twitter.com/osugame) which was used for general osu! news from then on.[^twitter-osugame]

## September

On September 2, osu! received several mapping updates, including:[^stable-b1650]

- The [SB load](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/SB_load) indicator, reflecting drawing efficiency of storyboard and background elements.
- The introduction of [Approach Rate](/wiki/Beatmap/Approach_rate) for configuring the speed of [approach circles](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Approach_circle) independently of [Overall Difficulty](/wiki/Beatmap/Overall_difficulty).
- Custom [slider velocity](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Slider_velocity) multipliers ranging from 0.5x to 2x.

60 [difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty) were affected by a Taiko bug causing drum-rolls to be incorrectly displayed and thus, all scores on them were deleted.[^taiko-reset]

## October

Members of the [Mapping Assistance Team](/wiki/People/Mapping_Assistance_Team) (MAT) gained the ability to [bubble](/wiki/Modding/Bubble) beatmaps deemed to be of good quality.[^mat-bubble]

## November

An osu! update added new sprites for the Taiko mode.[^stable-b1696]
