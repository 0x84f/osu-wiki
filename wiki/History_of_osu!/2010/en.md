# History of osu! 2010

## January

On the [Wai-con](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wai-Con) anime convention in Perth, osu! had an arcade booth which featured a fully self-contained arcade machine running a touch-based version of osu! on it called osu!arcade. Although playing too much on it could lead to sore fingers as some people had criticised, the prototype containing custom-made hardware and a built-in touchscreen was well-received by the community.[^wai-con]

## February

A new osu! update made small improvements in the overall user interface and added the ability to move all storyboard events by an arbitrary time value, allowing for more fine-tuned storyboard animations. In addition to this, usernames became clickable in chat logs.[^stable-b1460]

## March

Through February and March, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) organised an art competition about drawing banners for in-game challenges. After a [community voting](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/27112?n=1) concluded, the osu! team picked the final selection. The winner's art being officially used as well as one year of [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter) or physical goods being awarded were in prospect for the competition's finalist.[^art-challenge]

On March 8, an osu! update brought mainly performance and audio improvements to the game.[^stable-b1485]

## April

Due to infrastructure changes, the [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) was moved to the address `irc.ppy.sh`.[^irc]

This month, peppy introduced a new star rating difficulty algorithm in an osu! update.[^stable-b1596]

## August

Since August 2, users became able to change their username once. To change their name, they had to have received an osu!supporter tag at least once beforehand, either through purchase or as a gift.[^name-change]

[Bancho](wiki/de/BanchoBot) received the [`!report`](/wiki/de/BanchoBot#report) command, allowing people to notify chat moderators of users that showed unsolicited behaviour (e.g. spamming in chat).[^bancho-report]

[nardii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1017) gave peppy access to their [Twitter](https://twitter.com) account [@osugame](https://twitter.com/osugame) which was used for general osu! news from then on.[^twitter-osugame]

## September

On September 2, osu! received several mapping updates. Among those were a display for showing how efficiently storyboard and background elements are drawn on the screen, known as [SB load](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/SB_load). Additionally, users became able to set the speed of [approach circles](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Approach_circle) regardless of [overall difficulty](/wiki/Beatmap/Overall_difficulty). Slider speeds between 2x and 1/2x became able to be adjusted to custom values.[^stable-b1650]

60 [difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty) were affected by a Taiko bug causing drum-rolls to be incorrectly displayed and thus, all scores on them were deleted.[^taiko-reset]

## October

Members of the [Mapping Assistance Team](/wiki/People/Mapping_Assistance_Team) (MAT) became able to [bubble](/wiki/Modding/Bubble) beatmaps to indicate that they are of good quality.[^mat-bubble]

## November

An osu! update added new sprites for the Taiko mode.[^stable-b1696]
