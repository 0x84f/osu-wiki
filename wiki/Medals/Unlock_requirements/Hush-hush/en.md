# Unlock requirements for Hush-Hush medals

*Note: While some conditions for Hush-Hush medals are known, their solutions are intentionally omitted from this wiki to help preserve their secrecy.*

- A medal only appears in the profile of [gamemodes](/wiki/Game_mode) it can be obtained in. However, there are exceptions due to various reasons, such as star rating changes.
- Medals can only be obtained on beatmaps that are either [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked), [Loved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved), [Approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved) or [Qualified](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#qualified).
- Map-specific medals, which can only be obtained on certain beatmaps, are always related to songs from [Featured Artists](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists). This is a convention which has been emphasized more recently, so some older medals are an exception to this rule.
- Medals in the "Hush-Hush (Expert)" subcategory do not allow usage of any [difficulty reduction](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#difficulty-reduction) or [special](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#special) mods.
