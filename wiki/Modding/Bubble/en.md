# Bubble

The **bubble** (![](/wiki/shared/icon/bubble.gif "Bubble icon")) was a forum post icon used by the members of the [Beatmap Appreciation Team](/wiki/Modding/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) (BAT) and—later—[Mapping Assistance Team](/wiki/Modding/Mapping_Assistance_Team) (MAT). Being the next step of the old ranking system after a [proto-bubble](/wiki/Modding/Proto-bubble), a regular bubble meant that a beatmap was ready to be ranked from the BAT's point of view. Bubbled beatmaps would be eventually checked by another member of BAT and ranked or approved, if only minor changes to the map were required.

In the modern [beatmap ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure), an equivalent of a bubble is the first nomination<!-- TODO: nomination article link --> given by a [beatmap nominator](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators).

## History

*See also: [Mapping and modding timeline](/wiki/Mapping_and_Modding_Timeline)*

Bubbles were introduced by [peppy](/wiki/People/peppy) on October 29, 2007 for *"beatmaps that are being considered for ranked play (pending further moderator's feedback)"*. Setting a beatmap thread's icon to a bubble was a BAT's way to indicate that a beatmap was of a good quality and had satisfied the ranking criteria<!-- internal reference: https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/619 -->.

On October 3, 2010, the MAT received the permissions to use the bubble icon, alongside with the BAT<!-- internal reference: https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/38403 -->. This has de-facto deprecated the [proto-bubbles](/wiki/Modding/Proto-bubble), and both teams had been primarily using regular bubbles since.

After the [beatmap discussion](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion) system was fully implemented, the forum-based beatmap management controls were phased out, with bubbles being naturally replaced by nominations<!-- TODO: nomination article link -->.

## Mechanics

}}}

Bubbled beatmaps' threads were listed on the first pages of the [Pending beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/6) forum, ordered by their star priority and effectively acting as pinned forum threads.

### Requirements

In order to be bubbled, a beatmap's star priority had to be at least 8. Later, this threshould was increased to 12. <!-- internal source: https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/280845 -->.The requirement for the [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) category was a single bubble. Beatmaps going for the [Approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved) category had to have two consecutive bubbles placed by two different BATs.

### Bubble pop

An existing bubble could be **popped**:

- Automatically, by the mapper themselves, if they updated the map or any of its files.
- Manually, by a member of the BAT, if the beatmap required more efforts and couldn't be ranked in its current state.

In both cases, the beatmap thread's icon would be set to a popped bubble (![](/wiki/shared/icon/bubble-pop.gif "Bubble pop icon")). If a bubble was popped manually, ensuring that necessary changes be made and the map would eventually be rebubbled was assumed to be a personal responsibility of the BAT or MAT member behind the bubble pop.
