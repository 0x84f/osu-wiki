# Forum modding

**Forum modding**, also known as *Modding v1*, is a colloquial name of the [forum](/wiki/Forum)-based [modding](/wiki/Modding) and ranking system that was in effect until late 2017<!-- TODO: source? the only lead I have is https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/6239#discussion_r730355263 -->, when all [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) were switched to [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion) by default.

In the forum modding system, every beatmap had a single forum thread for all kinds of communication, which primarily included [mod posts](/wiki/Modding) from regular modders and members of the teams involved in the ranking process, such as [Mapping Assistance Team](/wiki/Modding/Mapping_Assistance_Team) (*MAT*) or [Beatmap Appreciation Team](/wiki/Modding/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) (*BAT*). Regular mods and mod responses were done via structured forum posts with a section per each difficulty, which included a list of time stamps, followed by the reasoning behind the issues and/or suggestions. Helpful mod posts were awarded with [kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu).

To change a beatmap's status according to the [ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure), a member of the MAT, BAT, or any other beatmap-managing team would make a forum post with a custom icon. After all ranking requirements were satisfied ([ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) compliance, acceptable quality, number of checks from the MAT, BAT, or mode-specific [beatmap nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) (*BN*)), the beatmap would be [ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) or [approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved) and gain a [leaderboard](/wiki/Beatmap#leaderboards).

## Beatmap thread

A forum thread was created for a beatmap during the initial [submission](/wiki/Submission). It served as a place for the dialogue between all people interested in the beatmap: regular players, the [beatmap host](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_host), [guest mappers](/wiki/Beatmap/Guest_difficulty), [modders](/wiki/Modding/Modder), and members of the beatmap ranking teams. Such a thread usually contained free-form comments and informal praises, guest difficulty requests and discussion, as well as structured feedback in form of the mod posts.

Along with the beatmap's advancement to the [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) category, the forum thread would be moved between different forum sections loosely mapped to the [beatmap categories](/wiki/Beatmap/Category):

- [Works In Progress/Help](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/10)
- [Pending Beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/6)
- [Ranked Beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/14)
- [Beatmap Graveyard](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/19)

### Star priority

*Main article: [Star priority](/wiki/Modding/Star_priority)*

In every forum section, beatmap threads were sorted by their *star priority*, which had several purposes:

- The star priority of 12 was used as a hard requirement for receiving a [bubble](/wiki/Modding/Bubble).
- Some modders and members of the BAT relied on star priority when making a decision which map to mod or review next.
- Finally, star priority was a rough measure of the beatmap's popularity among modders and mappers.

The priority of a beatmap could be increased by a single regular star available to anyone, or by several kudosu stars, each worth 3 kudosu. In modern [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion), the star priority's equivalent is amount of [hypes](/wiki/Beatmap/Hype).

### Thread icons

The beatmap's progress in the ranking procedure was indicated by a series of posts made by a member of the beatmap ranking teams. Each post would have a custom icon, which would also change the forum thread's icon to reflect its status:

- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/star.gif) **[Star](/wiki/Disambiguation/Star)**: the beatmap had potential to become ranked.
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/bubble.gif) **[Bubble](/wiki/Modding/Bubble)**: the beatmap had been checked by a member of the MAT, BAT, or BN, and might be ranked after another check.
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/bubble-pop.gif) **[Bubble pop](/wiki/Modding/Bubble#bubble-pop)**: the beatmap had issues that prevented it from being ranked.
- ![](img/icon/osu.gif) ![](img/icon/taiko.gif) ![](img/icon/ctb.gif) ![](img/icon/mania.gif) **Game mode icon**: the difficulties of the beatmap's respective [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode) were checked and approved by a BN.
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/heart.gif) **[Heart](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked)** or ![](/wiki/shared/icon/flame.gif) **[flame](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved)**: the beatmap had been ranked or approved.
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/broken-heart.gif) **Broken heart**: the beatmap had been unranked due to severe composition issues or lack of compliance to the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/nuke.gif) **[Nuked](/wiki/Modding/Nuke)**: the beatmap could not be even considered ranked in its current state.

## Communication

### Mod

In the old modding system, mods were regular forum posts. Unlike in the modern [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion), a typical mod post covered the whole beatmap and could sometimes span across several screens. While people were free to express their thoughts in any form they wished, the majority of modders adhered to the specific structure to make their posts more readable:

- There were several sections, each corresponding to a single difficulty, or a list of beatmap-wide settings/issues.
- Each section contained a list of timestamps, often pointing to specific [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object).
- Each timestamp was followed by a short description of the issue, sometimes with screenshots which would further clarify it.
- Based on the severity of the issue, some modders were using [colour coding](/wiki/BBCode#colour) in their post to highlight unrankable issues or key points.

### Response

While not strongly required, it was a sign of good manners for mappers to reply to every mod received. The reply would typically contain a quote of the original post, where every suggestion was followed by a mapper's response. Similarly to the mods, many mappers used two or a few more different font colours to convey their responses and help distinguish between accepted and rejected suggestions.

### Kudosu

*Main article: [Kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu)*

If a mod post was deemed useful, the mapper, or a member of the BAT, could award it with a kudosu. According to an unwritten rule, only the first mod post of every person would be able to gain kudosu. Regardless of how many suggestions were there in a post, or how useful it was to the mapper, the amount of kudosu given out was always the same:

- 1 kudosu, under most circumstances.
- 2 kudosu, in case the beatmap thread was inactive for more than a week. This was supposed to promote the modding of old maps.

The total amount of kudosu served as an activity metric for modders. Additionally, most people had been spending their accumulated kudosu to increase the [star priority](/wiki/Modding/Star_priority) of the maps they liked or wanted to promote.

### Shortcomings

In the forum-based modding system, a lot of actions were manual, which caused many different mistakes. Examples:

- The mapper's feedback could be missing.
- Mods could be partially or completely ignored, intentionally or not.
- Maps could be ranked with unrankable issues, or without the approval of mode-specific nominator(s).

The [beatmap discussion system](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion), along with the [code of conduct for modding and mapping](/wiki/Rules/Code_of_Conduct_for_Modding_and_Mapping#making-a-mod-post), were developed to address these issues and make modding a more enjoyable experience for everyone involved.
