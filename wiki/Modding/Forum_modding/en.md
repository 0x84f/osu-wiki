# Forum modding

**Forum modding**, also known as *Modding v1*, is a colloquial name of the [forum](/wiki/Forum)-based [modding](/wiki/Modding) and ranking system that was mainly used until late 2017, when all new and inactive [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) were switched to [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion) by default.

In the forum modding system, every beatmap had a forum thread for communication and logging of the [ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure).

## Beatmap thread

A forum thread was created for a beatmap during the initial [submission](/wiki/Submission) and contained free-form comments, guest difficulty interactions, and structured feedback in form of the mod posts. It served as the main hub for discussion between all users interested in the beatmap: regular players, the [beatmap host](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_host), [guest mappers](/wiki/Beatmap/Guest_difficulty), [modders](/wiki/Modding/Modder), and members of these beatmap ranking teams:

- [Beatmap Appreciation Team (*BAT*)](/wiki/Modding/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team)
- [Mapping Assistance Team (*MAT*)](/wiki/Modding/Mapping_Assistance_Team)
- [Quality Assurance Team (*QAT*)](/wiki/Modding/Quality_Assurance_Team)
- [Beatmap Nominators (*BN*)](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators)

A forum thread was automatically be moved between different forum sections loosely tied to the [beatmap categories](/wiki/Beatmap/Category):

- [Works In Progress/Help](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/10)
- [Pending Beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/6)
- [Ranked Beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/14)
- [Beatmap Graveyard](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/19)

### Star priority

*Main article: [Star priority](/wiki/Modding/Star_priority)*

In every forum section, beatmap threads were sorted by their *star priority*, which had several purposes:

- 12 star priority was required before a beatmap could receive a [bubble](/wiki/Modding/Bubble).
- Some modders and members of the BAT relied on star priority when making a decision which map to mod or review next.
- Star priority was a rough measure of the beatmap's popularity among modders and mappers.

The priority of a beatmap could be increased by mods receiving kudosu or users shooting kudosu stars. In modern [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion), star priority is comparable to a beatmap's [hype](/wiki/Beatmap/Hype) count.

### Thread icons

The beatmap's progress in the ranking procedure was shown through posts made by members of beatmap ranking teams. Each post had a custom icon, which would also change the forum thread's icon to reflect its status:

- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/star.gif) **[Star](/wiki/Disambiguation/Star)**: the beatmap had potential to become ranked.
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/bubble.gif) **[Bubble](/wiki/Modding/Bubble)**: the beatmap had been checked by a member of the MAT, BAT, or BN, and might be ranked after another check.
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/bubble-pop.gif) **[Bubble pop](/wiki/Modding/Bubble#bubble-pop)**: the beatmap had issues that prevented it from being ranked.
- ![](img/icon/osu.gif) ![](img/icon/taiko.gif) ![](img/icon/ctb.gif) ![](img/icon/mania.gif) **Game mode icon**: the difficulties of the beatmap's respective [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode) were checked and approved by a BN.
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/heart.gif) **[Heart](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked)** or ![](/wiki/shared/icon/flame.gif) **[flame](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved)**: the beatmap had been qualified, ranked or approved.
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/broken-heart.gif) **Broken heart**: the beatmap had been disqualified or unranked due to severe composition issues or lack of compliance to the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/nuke.gif) **[Nuke](/wiki/Modding/Nuke)**: the beatmap could not be even considered ranked in its current state.

## Communication

### Mod

Unlike in the modern [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion), a typical forum mod post covered the whole beatmap and could sometimes span across several screens. While users were free to express their thoughts in any form they wished, the majority of modders adhered to a specific structure to make their posts more readable:

- There were several sections corresponding to a single difficulty or a list of beatmap-wide settings/issues.
- Each section contained a list of timestamps, often pointing to specific [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object).
- Each timestamp was followed by a short description of the issue, sometimes with screenshots to further clarify a concern.
- Based on the severity of the issue, some modders used [colour coding](/wiki/BBCode#colour) in their post to highlight unrankable issues or key points.

The modern *review* system<!-- TODO: article? --> was created to mimic forum modding in [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion).

### Response

While not required, mappers were expected to reply to every mod received. A reply typically contained a quote of the original post, where every suggestion was followed by a mapper's response. As with mod posts, many mappers used two or more font colours to convey their responses and help distinguish between accepted and rejected suggestions.

### Kudosu

*Main article: [Kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu)*

If a mod post was deemed useful, the mapper or a member of the QAT/BAT/BN could award it with kudosu. According to an unwritten rule, only a user's first mod post was elligible to gain kudosu. Regardless of how many suggestions were in a post or how useful it was to the mapper, the amount of kudosu received was consistent:

- 1 kudosu, under most circumstances.
- 2 kudosu, in case the beatmap thread was inactive for more than a week. This was supposed to promote modding on older maps.

Kudosu served as an activity metric for modders. Most users spent their accumulated kudosu to increase [star priority](/wiki/Modding/Star_priority) of the maps they liked or wanted to promote.

### Shortcomings

In the forum-based modding system, a lot of actions were manual, which often led to mistakes. Examples:

- The mapper's feedback could be missing.
- Mods could be partially or completely ignored, intentionally or not.
- Maps could be ranked with unrankable issues, or without the approval of mode-specific nominator(s).

The [beatmap discussion system](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion), along with the [code of conduct for modding and mapping](/wiki/Rules/Code_of_Conduct_for_Modding_and_Mapping#making-a-mod-post), were developed to address these issues and make modding a more enjoyable experience for everyone involved.
