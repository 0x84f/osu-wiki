# Beat

A **beat** is a repeating event or unit of time in music, which creates the rhythm that a person would tap or nod their head to while listening.

A whole beat is referred to as 1/1 and is contained between two adjacent white lines on the [timeline](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Timelines). Equal amounts of beats are grouped into [measures](/wiki/Music_theory/Measure), which start from [downbeats](/wiki/Music_theory/Downbeat) represented by big white ticks.

Other notes are expressed through a beat by dividing or multiplying its length. The beatmap editor's [beat snap divisor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Beat_Snap_Divisor) does that automatically for a mapper, allowing for changing the temporal granularity on the fly.
