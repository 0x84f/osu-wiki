<!--TODO: add example of syncopation, maybe an image-->

# Syncopation

**Syncopation** is the accenting of a note which would usually not be accented. Syncopation can also be mapped in somewhat by placing notes off-beat i.e. red or blue timeline ticks. The [time signature](/wiki/Music_theory/Time_signature) of a piece of music gives an indication of a regular [rhythm](/wiki/Music_theory/Rhythm) pattern of strong and weak beats. A syncopated rhythm goes against this expectation by putting the accent on weak beats, thereby creating counterflow.
