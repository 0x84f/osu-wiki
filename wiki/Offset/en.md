# Offset

**Offset** is a common name for a family of settings which align different audio-related aspects of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) together. While most of the time the term alone refers to [uninherited timing points](#mapping), offsets in general apply to different areas of the beatmap or gameplay.

Depending on the type of an offset, it may be set up by the mapper, or customized by the player or one of the website's administrators, in case of beatmaps needing post-ranking timing corrections. Most of the offsets are applied on a per-beatmap basis, with the exception for the [universal offset](#gameplay), which shifts the audio globally for all beatmaps and [hitsounds](/wiki/Beatmapping/Hitsound).

## Types

### Gameplay

- [Local offset](/wiki/Glossary/Local_song_offset), a per-beatmap setting that shifts the objects in time during gameplay.
- [Online offset](/wiki/Beatmap/Online_offset), a timing change applied by [NAT](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team) to [ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) beatmaps with incorrect beatmap offset in order to adjust it.
- [Universal offset](/wiki/Client/Options/Universal_offset), a client-side setting that globally affects the timing of beatmaps by shifting the audio.

### Mapping

- [Uninherited timing point](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Timing#uninherited-timing-point) ("red line"), the start of a new [timing section](/wiki/Beatmapping/Timing_section). Timing points reside at an offset relative to the start of the audio file, but the timing point itself is also sometimes called "offset".
- [Inherited timing point](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Timing#inherited-timing-point) ("green line"), a [timing section](/wiki/Beatmapping/Timing_section) which controls settings such as [kiai](/wiki/Gameplay/Kiai_time), [sampleset](/wiki/Beatmapping/Sampleset), [slider velocity](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Slider_velocity), and volume level of hitsounds.
- A beatmap offset, the amount of time between the start of the audio file and the song's first [downbeat](/wiki/Music_theory/Downbeat) measured in milliseconds.

## Beatmap settings

- Countdown offset, a setting which affects the appearance of [countdown](/wiki/Beatmapping/Countdown) before the first hit object.
- Audio offset, or [audio lead-in](/wiki/Beatmapping/Lead-in).
- Video offset, a setting that shows how soon a background video should play relatively to the audio track.
