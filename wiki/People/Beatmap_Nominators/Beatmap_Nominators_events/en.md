During the event, Beatmap Nominators were tasked with ranking maps from users who've never ranked a map before in the game mode of their choice. Only maps [qualified](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#qualification) during the event would be eligible to be nominated. 

Nominators who ranked **at least 4 maps** during the event would be given a 1 month supporter reward. Whereas the overall top 4 nominators across all game modes and the top 1 in each game mode would be given an exclusive BN mug and a badge to accompany it.
