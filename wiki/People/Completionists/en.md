# Completionists

**Completionists** are players who have completed every [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) of a given [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode). Because the amount of Ranked beatmaps increases every day, this feat becomes progressively more difficult to achieve.

As of September 2023, this achievement is recognised through a [profile badge](/wiki/Community/Profile_badge):

![osu!](img/osu.png "osu! completionist badge") ![osu!taiko](img/taiko.png "osu!taiko completionist badge") ![osu!catch](img/catch.png "osu!catch completionist badge") ![osu!mania](img/mania.png "osu!mania completionist badge")

## Completion criteria

In order to be considered a completionist, a player must play every existing Ranked beatmap of a given game mode with no [difficulty reduction mods](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#difficulty-reduction). This does not include converted beatmaps for [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko), [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch), and [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania). For osu!mania, only 4K and 7K beatmaps are considered for completion.
