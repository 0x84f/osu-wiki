# Completionists

Completionists are players who take on the extremely daunting task of playing **every [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap)** of a given game mode. With the amount of Ranked beatmaps increasing every day, this feat is becoming progressively more difficult to achieve, requiring insane amounts of dedication and perseverance.

As of August 2023, this achievement is recognised through a special [profile badge](/wiki/Community/Profile_badge)

## Completion criteria

In order to be considered a completionist, a player must play every existing Ranked beatmap of a given game mode with no [difficulty reduction mods](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#difficulty-reduction), this does not include converted beatmaps for [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko), [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch), and [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania). For osu!mania, only 4K and 7K beatmaps are considered for completion.
