# Performance Points Committee

The **Performance Points Committee** is a panel of well-versed players and developers who facilitate and approve updates to the [performance points](/wiki/Performance_points) and [star rating](/wiki/Beatmap/Star_rating) algorithms. Their goal is to help [osu! developers](/wiki/People/Developers) push changes faster and with more community coordination.

The Performance Points Committee's responsibilities include:

- Reviewing and developing changes in difficulty calculation algorithms
- Organizing development efforts and helping contributors
- Deciding which changes will be deployed and used in the game

## Workflow

Whenever a new difficulty calculation proposal is created on [GitHub](https://github.com/ppy/osu), the Performance Points Committee relevant to the ruleset it's for will be tagged with a review request. After that members of the committee must review and test the proposal and write a review on its GitHub page. When there are enough committee approvals the change is considered ready for deploy and is passed to osu! developers for final code inspection before merging into the game.

When there are enough merged proposals the osu! developers will start preparing for a performance points deploy which will recalculate all existing scores using the new algorithms. Performance Points Committees are tasked with writing a news post about the upcoming changes.

## Communication

Performance Points Committees mainly operate on the [Performance Points Discord server](https://discord.gg/aqPCnXu) with some committees having separate servers for their respective ruleset. Committees also maintain a [Twitter account](https://x.com/pp_committee) that is being used for official announcements and difficulty calculation related news. You can also contact any of the members of the committees privately through osu! private messages.

## Members

Members of the committees are hand-picked by osu! developers and/or other committee members and consist of people with a lot of experience working on the difficulty calculation system.

### osu!
