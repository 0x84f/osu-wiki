# Performance Points Maintainers

The **Performance Points Maintainers** maintain the [performance points](/wiki/Performance_points) and [star rating](/wiki/Beatmap/Star_rating) algorithms via the [osu!(lazer) repository](https://github.com/ppy/osu). Their goal is to help [osu! developers](/wiki/People/Developers) push changes faster and with more community coordination.

The maintainers regularly look after the [difficulty calculation project](https://github.com/orgs/ppy/projects/12) and act as a final set of reviewers on any PP changes submitted or approved by the [Performance Points Committee](/wiki/People/Performance_Points_Committee). Unlike the Performance Points Committee, maintainers can merge PP changes into the `pp-dev` branch in order to confirm their place in the next batch of changes.

The maintainers liase with the Performance Points Committees across all game modes to ensure all changes are tested and work as expected. They also take charge in writing the news posts for each batch of changes.

## Communication

The maintainers primarily operate in the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) and [Performance Points Discord server](https://discord.gg/aqPCnXu).

## Members

Maintainers are hand-picked by osu! developers and consist of people with a lot of experience organising performance points efforts.
