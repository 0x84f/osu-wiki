# Performance Points Maintainers

The **Performance Points Maintainers** maintain the [performance points](/wiki/Performance_points) and [star rating](/wiki/Beatmap/Star_rating) algorithms via the [osu!(lazer) repository](https://github.com/ppy/osu). Their duty is to take responsibility for all of the difficulty and performance calculations off of [osu! developers](/wiki/People/Developers).

The maintainers regularly look after the [difficulty calculation project](https://github.com/orgs/ppy/projects/12) and act as a final set of reviewers on any PP changes submitted or approved by the [Performance Points Committee](/wiki/People/Performance_Points_Committee). Unlike the Performance Points Committee, maintainers can merge PP changes into the `pp-dev` branch in order to confirm their place in the next batch of changes.

The maintainers liase with Performance Points Committees across all game modes to ensure these changes are tested and work as expected so that they can plan each batch of changes for deployment alongside writing the accompanying news post.

## Communication

The maintainers primarily operate in the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) and [Performance Points Discord server](https://discord.gg/aqPCnXu).

## Members

Maintainers are hand-picked by osu! developers and consist of people with a lot of experience organising performance points efforts.
