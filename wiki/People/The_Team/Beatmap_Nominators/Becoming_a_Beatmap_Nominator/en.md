# Becoming a Beatmap Nominator

Users interested in joining the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) need to go through an application process overseen by the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team) (NAT).

Applications are conducted via the [NAT website](http://bn.mappersguild.com/bnapps).

Applicants are required to meet a minimum [kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu) threshold, submit at least two maps they have recently modded, and complete a [Beatmap Nominator Test](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Nominator_Test) on the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) in order to submit their application. A message from the NAT will be sent once a verdict has been decided. More information on applying can be found [on the website]((http://bn.mappersguild.com/bnapps)).

## Basic criteria

Modders aiming to apply to the Beatmap Nominators must fulfil the following criteria:

- They have accumulated at least 200 [kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu) for osu! modders, or 150 [kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu) for osu!taiko/osu!catch/osu!mania modders.
- They provide 3 of their mods which they think qualify them to be a part of the Beatmap Nominators.
  - Previous members of BN/NAT are allowed to submit a minimum of 2 mods for their application.

### Modding expectations

*See also: [Common modding mistakes](/wiki/Guides/) and [osu!mania modding guide](/wiki/Guides/osu!mania_modding_guide/)*

Submitted mods should show that a user is capable of analysing and improving maps to a standard fit for the Beatmap Nominators.

The following are modding traits expected of Beatmap Nominators. Failure to display any of these traits may result in a rejected application.

- **Coverage of all common difficulty levels**
  - Most beatmaps will have a spread of [difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty/) ranging from easy up to expert, and so Beatmap Nominators must be proficient in modding such difficulties. Proficiency in modding extremely high level difficulties is not required.
- **Identification of unrankable issues, including ones tools can't detect, such as incorrect timing or metadata**
- **Comparison between parts of a map to support issues or suggestions**
  - Referencing other parts of the map is useful for keeping suggestions in line with the original styles and ideas the mapper has in their map.
- **Commentary about a wide variety of map elements, such as rhythm, spacing, movement, intensity, contrast, and consistency**
  - While Beatmap Nominators are encouraged to ask for help when needed, they should be able to judge almost all aspects of mapping independently to a decent level.
- **Identification of both isolated issues and general map-wide issues**
- **Consideration of mappers' intentions when identifying issues and giving suggestions**
  - Avoid suggesting your own mapping styles or preferences if they contradict the mapper's intended style. If there is an issue related to the mapper's style, try to frame your suggestions around what they originally intended.
- **Ability to make useful suggestions and spot mistakes for mappers of varying experience**
  - Beatmap Nominators will often deal with very experienced mappers or high quality maps which may not require much feedback. It is important therefore to still be able to spot mistakes and suggest improvements for even the most seasoned of mappers.
  - For the application, it is not recommended to submit mods of maps from beginner mappers which lack the fundamentals. Instead, submitted mods should be on maps that are ready for a BN to look at.
- **Communicating with the mapper in as clear a manner as possible**
  - Mod posts should explain clearly the issue and the solution as clearly and concisely as possible to avoid confusing the mapper, or even having their suggestion applied incorrectly. Specialised terminology should also be generally avoided.

## Application Process

### Individual stage

During the individual stage, 2-4 evaluators are randomly assigned to the application. Sometimes, BNs are invited to be an evaluator, but there will always be at least one NAT assigned to the application.

The evaluators will look over your application and evaluate your modding performance and your behaviour. They will typically comment down any positive and negative posts in the mods. Each evaluator will then vote “pass”, “neutral”, or “fail” for the application.

Applicants will be evaluated on the following criteria:
- Modding: Knowledge of the general [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) and specific criteria of each game mode. Adherence to the [modding expectations](#modding-expectations). Additional abilities like Metadata, Timing, and some others will also be taken into consideration.
- General attitude: Tone of delivery of the mods and other behavioural expectations from the [Code of Conduct](/wiki/Rules/Code_of_Conduct_for_Modding_and_Mapping), as well as general behaviour in chat/forums.

Any comments and votes from evaluators at this stage are hidden from other evaluators.

### Group stage

Applications will progress to the group stage when either:

- All assigned evaluators have submitted their individual evaluation.
- The majority of the evaluators have submitted their individual evaluation, where they have unanimously failed the applicant.

At this stage, the comments and votes from each evaluator are revealed, and in the case of an ambiguous verdict, they will discuss until a consensus is reached.

Feedback is then written based on the comments of the evaluators and the application result is sent back to the applicant. Successful applicants are added as a probationary BN immediately after the result is sent.

## Cooldowns

Depending on your status, your cooldown before you can apply again may vary.

### Failed applications

You have these requirements if you failed a Beatmap Nominator application and apply again.

| Type | Cooldown |
| :-- | :-- |
| Standard | 90 days |
| Reduced | 45–60 days |
| Failed the [Beatmap Nominator Test](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Nominator_Test) | 30 days |

### Rejoining after being removed from the Beatmap Nominators

Users who have recently left the Beatmap Nominators may have different requirements to rejoin compared to when they first joined. For users who have performed well prior to leaving, they may be able to rejoin with relaxed requirements, or no requirements at all. The NAT will inform the user if they have the opportunity to fast-track their way back into the Beatmap Nominators.

If you were a Beatmap Nominator before, these requirements apply unless you have failed an application since last time you were a Beatmap Nominator.

The 8-mod requirement for those applying after being removed for activity is shared across all modes.

| Type | Cooldown | Activity Requirements |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Standard | 60 days | *N/A* |
| Activity | 30 days | 8 mods in 60 days |
| Good | 30 days | *N/A* |

Former beatmap nominators who resigned on good terms within the past 6 months are given the option to instantly request a rejoin as a full member, without having to take the [Beatmap Nominator Test](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Nominator_Test), nor provide mods for evaluation.

Former Beatmap Nominators who resigned on good terms within the past year still have to reapply properly in order to rejoin, and they will become full members immediately upon getting accepted.
