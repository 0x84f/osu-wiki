# Nomination Assessment Team

*See also: [Beatmap Nominator evaluations](Evaluations)*

The **Nomination Assessment Team** (***NAT***) are the moderators of the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) (*BN*) and ensure the beatmapping side of osu! stays functional.

Members of the NAT are distinguished by their red username and user title. Like the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team) (*GMT*), they have site-wide moderation permissions and a dark red username in the game's chat channels, and like the BN, they possess the ability to [nominate](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#nominations), [qualify](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#qualification), and [reset nominations](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#nomination-resets) on beatmaps. In this area they are considered largely the same as [full BNs](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators#full-beatmap-nominators), and all [BN rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Rules) and [expectations](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Expectations) besides activity apply to NAT members.

**All members of the Nomination Assessment Team are sworn to uphold [the Contributor Code of Conduct](/wiki/Contributor_Code_of_Conduct) in addition to the normal [Community Rules](/wiki/Rules).**

***Note: To report a member of NAT misbehaving or breaking the Contributor Code of Conduct, please contact the [account support team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Account_support_team#support@ppy.sh).***

## Responsibilities

The NAT are responsible for a variety of mapping-related tasks, with each NAT member falling into one of two subgroups: **Evaluators** and **Advisors**. Each subgroup outlines the responsibilities of its members.

###Evaluators

Each member of the **Evaluator** subgroup is primarily responsible for:
- **Evaluation:** Evaluating the proficiency and activity of both current Beatmap Nominators and applicants. *For full details on how evaluations work, please see the [evaluations](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team/Evaluations) page.*
- **Modding:** Modding at least 3 beatmaps per month. This guarantees the NAT are up to date with the modding community when evaluating Beatmap Nominators.

As a result of high evaluator demand due to high volumes of [BN applications](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Becoming_a_Beatmap_Nominator), most NAT members are part of this subgroup, and all new NAT members start off in this subgroup. Potential NAT candidates are primarily judged by their ability to evaluate applicants for this reason.

###Advisors

As a group, **Advisors** are required to maintain:
- **Communication:** Promoting transparency and maintaining good relations between the NAT and the mapping/modding community, including making announcements, participating in public threads or forums, and answering any questions one may have regarding the BN or NAT. Being an active nominator can be greatly beneficial as well, as it keeps the collective NAT in touch with whoever they're moderating or evaluating.
- **Internal affairs:** Making and discussing proposals regarding internal matters (such as the specifics regarding the evaluation process), regularly checking NAT activity, and hosting internal meetings.
- **Ranking criteria changes:** Contributing to, participating in, and maintaining the [Ranking Criteria Forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/87). This includes making amendements to the ranking criteria whenever necessary.
- **Development and documentation:** Documenting topics surrounding the mapping/modding community (such as the ranking process) and developing and maintaining related tools and websites (such as [Mapset Verifier](https://github.com/Naxesss/MapsetVerifier) or [the NAT/BN website](https://bn.mappersguild.com/home)).
- **Moderation:** Handling user reports and assessing inappropriate behaviour of Beatmap Nominators. This subcategory is a joint effort between the NAT and the GMT.
- **Miscellaneous maintenance:** Included but not limited to:
  - Handling vetoes.
  - Maintaining the RC Test.
  - Judging nomination reset severity.

Advisors make sure that BNs and other members of the mapping/modding community remain informed and feel heard, in addition to mainting all the bits and pieces required to keep everything running in the mapping/modding scene. Advisors are generally made up of experienced evaluators that prefer to focus on managerial matters regarding the mapping/modding scene.

Dividing the NAT into two groups is necessary for the overall organization and productivity of the group, allowing for a more streamlined assignment of tasks. Delegating tasks keeps NAT members from being overwhelmed while simultaneously avoiding a diffusion of responsiblity.

***Key note:*** ***A member of the NAT can engage with any task within either subgroup despite what their subgroup may be listed as.*** For example, if a member of the NAT is an evaluator, they may still make announcements or participate in discussions. Assigned subgroups only describe what each member is formally responsible for.

##Activity

Depending on their subgroup, each NAT member has different activity requirements. Evaluators are required to consistently evaluate applicants and current BNs while upholding aforementioned modding requirements, and advisors are each required to uphold key parts of the ranking process, with each specific task differing from member to member.

Members who are found to be inactive will be confronted by other members of the NAT. If a swift resolution to their inactivity isn't feasable, they will be removed from the NAT. Members of the Evaluator subgroup working on other mapping-related projects may be exempt from activity requirements on a case-by-case basis, or moved to the Advisor subgroup to better reflect their contribution.

## Promotion to the NAT

Before joining the NAT, a user must either be a full member of the Beatmap Nominators, or previously an NAT member and still involved in the community. Most NAT candidates are initially considered based on their commitment to helping the mapping and modding community, and further demonstration of their ability to contribute to a multitude of NAT responsibilities is usually the basis for being promoted.

Since all new NAT members start off as evaluators, it's important that NAT candidates are exceptional in assessing the proficiency of others. Full BNs may be given the opportunity to participate in mock evaluations alongside the NAT's real ones, giving them an opportunity to practice. NAT candidates have a much better chance of being promoted if their evaluations are thorough and come to similar conclusions as the NAT (or have supportive reasoning otherwise).

The NAT keep tabs on potential NAT candidates over long periods of time, and occasionally convene to decide if a candidate should be promoted, similar to how BN evaluations are done. BNs are also allowed to ask about joining the NAT if they want to receive feedback and make sure they're being considered. However, depending on the activity and skillset of the current NAT, there may not be a need for new members. New NAT will likely be promoted only when one of the current members is becoming less active, or there are new workloads requiring more members, etc.

###Becoming an advisor

Evaluators have the chance to become advisors if they've shown themselves capable of properly handling the advisory tasks outlined above. As long as there are enough evaluators to keep up with the required workload, an evaluator may announce their decision to become an advisor to the rest of the NAT, explicitly stating either their existing contributions or their planned contributions. They will then be subject to activity expectations depending on their specific situation. An evaluator may be deemed unsuitable for an advisory position if their proposed or existing contributions are seen as lackluster or unnecessary. 

## Team members

*Note: All NAT members speak English in addition to the language(s) listed below unless noted otherwise.*

The [Nomination Assessment Team group page](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/7) lists all of the team members. In addition to areas mentioned below, all NAT members take part in [reviewing audio and visual content included in beatmaps](/wiki/Rules/Visual_Content_Considerations#getting-your-image-assessed).
