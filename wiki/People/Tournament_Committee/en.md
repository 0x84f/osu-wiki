# Tournament Committee

The **Tournament Committee** is a panel of skilled and established organisers and helpers in the tournament scene. The panel was first announced to the public on July 22, 2021 through the `#tournaments` channel in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy) in response to the rapidly growing community tournament scene in osu!.

The Tournament Committee’s responsibilities related to advising the [Account Support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team) include advising the account support team on:
- Responses to general inquiries at the tournaments email
- Whether to hand out tournament bans and tournament staffing bans and for how long on a case-by-case basis
- Which tournaments have concluded and need their badges applied to winners’ profiles
- Which tournament should be awarded badges to the top three teams
Additionally, the tournament committee performs the following roles independent of the account support team:
- Regularly reviewing the [Official tournament support](/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support) page for revisions when necessary
- Investigating reports from the [tournament reports form](https://pif.ephemeral.ink/tournament-reports)
- Checking each tournament upon conclusion to ensure tournaments requesting official support all meet the criteria
- Denying badges to tournaments that have requested it should they breach the Official Support criteria
- Advising the news post team on which tournaments requesting a news post specifically for tournament registrations and conclusion should be approved
- Maintaining communications with the general player-base regarding changes to official support criteria and the status of all tournaments that have requested official support



## Contest Committee

The **Contest Committee** is a subgroup directly associated with the Tournament Committee which is specifically dedicated to evaluating beatmapping contests.

Their responsibilities include:

- Observing the general contest scene and advising the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team) on a case-by-case basis
- Regularly reviewing the [Official beatmapping contest support](/wiki/Contests/Official_support) page for revisions when necessary

The panel was first announced to the public on February 28, 2024 through the [Mapping Discussion](/community/forums/topics/1890429) forum.

## Tournament Committee Workflow

### Tournament Reports

Tournament reports are the preferred way for players and tournament staff alike to report infringements of the Official Support expectations and eligibility. When a new report is sent in, a new thread about that report is automatically created and the tournament committee team is automatically pinged. Members will read the report and determine whether to pursue action based on the report contents. Such action includes but is not limited to:

- Noting the tournament for investigation pending further reports if this report alone is not enough to warrant further action
- Further investigation and context gathering
- Reaching out to the infringing party for further information about the events in the report
- Voting on whether to withhold a tournament badge
- Voting on whether to hand out a tournament ban
- Voting on whether to hand out a tournament staffing ban

### Tournament Review

Assuming the tournament has submitted a request for screening in a timely manner, removed any disallowed players from the tournament, and sent a conclusion email with the badge attached, the Tournament Committee will assign two random members to review the tournament before confirming its badge. The assigned members will ensure the following:

- The format is eligible for badge
- The tournament theme does not violate community rules
- Any signup restrictions are geographically and/or culturally consistent
- Any unofficial screening process is open-source with a publicly available dataset
- All results are up-to-date on both the tournament’s bracket and any public-facing documents, such as a spreadsheet
- All multiplayer lobby links are publicly available
- Staff and player lists are publicly available
- The badge design does not contain any art owned by a third party

Assuming the tournament meets all these checks, the assigned members will mark the tournament as approved for badging, and the account support team will apply the badge at a later time to the winner(s) profile(s). If the tournament does not meet one or more of these checks, the assigned members will ask the account support team to request any necessary changes from the tournament organiser(s) to meet these checks before marking the tournament as approved for badging. If these changes are not possible after the tournament’s conclusion, the tournament committee will hold an anonymous vote as to whether to approve or deny a badge for the tournament.

If a tournament has been reported for violating the Official Support criteria and has submitted its conclusion email, and the Tournament Committee has deemed these reports actionable, the Tournament Committee will take the following course of action:

- Determine if the issues brought up in the report break any of the Official Support criteria
- If they do break those criteria, determine whether the severity of those infringements could potentially warrant withholding a badge from the tournament or giving a tournament staffing ban to any of the staff of that tournament
- If they are severe enough to warrant such action, independently investigate the events detailed in the report to ensure the report’s veracity and gather additional context
- Reach out to the infringing party, e.g. the tournament organiser, to get further information on the events detailed in the report
- If after this investigation is over and the Tournament Committee is still considering handing out relevant punishment, hold an anonymous vote to determine whether to do so and the severity of such punishment

### News Posts

When an email requesting registration and conclusion news posts for a tournament is received, a thread is automatically created with an embed message of the email’s text. Any Tournament Committee member who sees this will ping the rest of the group for visibility. The committee will then check if the tournament is eligible based on the requirements on the Official Support wiki page before moving forward. If the tournament is eligible and the consensus in discussion around the tournament is positive after 48 hours, the Tournament Committee will forward the request to the news post team and approve the request. If the tournament does not pass one of these steps, the request will be denied.

### Top Three Badge Support

If a tournament host believes their tournament has achieved the highest level of production quality and organisation possible, they can request to receive badge prizes for all three finalists in their tournament. If a host requests to be awarded with this distinction, then in addition to the typical steps for tournament review as listed above, the assigned members will also notify the rest of the group of the request for top three badge support. Based on discussion around the tournament and its quality, either the request will be denied, or an anonymous vote will be called for the tournament to receive top three badge support.

### Public Communication

Public communication by the Tournament Committee is handled through several channels. The purposes for these sometimes overlap, but all are official sources of information kept up-to-date by the Tournament Committee.

The Tournament Committee maintains an [account on X](https://twitter.com/osu_tcomm) (formerly Twitter) where the committee broadcasts major changes and updates of various types. Not all changes are communicated here, but many of the most important changes are communicated and clarified through this channel.

The [Community Tournament Status Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bV5MyrJZI0F52Bx9EcYxdfRu8qGnhWRBKdXHK9uPbO0/edit?usp=sharing) is a publicly viewable spreadsheet detailing the status of all tournaments that have requested official support, i.e. all tournaments that requested screening. This sheet shows all tournaments dating back to January 14th, 2023, and contains a description of the status of the tournament at any given time, including whether a badge was applied or denied. If a badge was denied, the reason for denial is stated on the sheet.

The [Official Tournament Support Updates thread](/community/forums/topics/1715676) is a pinned thread in the [Tournaments & Contests forum](/community/forums/126) which contains all updates to the Official Tournament Support wiki dating back to February 1st, 2023. This thread is updated and bumped every time a change is made to the Official Tournament Support wiki. This thread also contains links to the Official Support wiki and the Community Tournament Status Tracker.

### Adding New Members

New members to the Tournament Committee must meet the following basic criteria before being considered for the position at all:
- Be at least 18 years old
- Pass a security check

Whether a prospective member applies via email or is brought forward by an existing member, the process is the same. A thread is either automatically created by the email application or created manually by a member of the Tournament Committee, and the whole committee is notified. The candidate is discussed in-depth, with special consideration paid to the uniqueness of the candidate compared to current members and the candidate’s history in the tournament scene. Assuming discussion is mixed or mostly positive, an anonymous vote is held to determine whether the candidate is added.

### Votes

The Tournament Committee frequently makes use of anonymous voting when making important decisions. Typical uses are listed above, but those are not fully inclusive. The voting requirements also differ based on the use-case. All typical votes also require “strict participation,” meaning that if 75% of the Tournament Committee does not participate by the vote deadline, voting is extended by 24 hours, and the committee is pinged for further participation. Further, all votes require at least an absolute majority, at least 50%, for action to be taken. Votes on many topics have the same requirements, but there are slight differences on some common topics listed below.

Withholding Badge Support:
- Minimum three days open
- Strict participation
- Absolute majority required

Tournament Bans:
- Minimum three days open
- Strict participation
- Absolute majority required

Tournament Staffing Bans:
- Minimum three days open
- Strict participation
- Absolute majority required

Top Three Badge Support:
- Minimum four days open
- Strict participation
- 80% voting yes to pass

Adding New Members:
- Minimum four days open

## Tournament Ban Lengths

Common tournament ban lengths can be found on the [Tournament bans](/wiki/Help_centre/Tournament_bans) wiki page.

## FAQ

### Who gives out tournament bans?

The account support team gives out tournament bans. The Tournament Committee advises the account support team on many tournament bans, but ultimately is solely an advisory committee when it comes to tournament bans.

### Who does screening?

The account support team does screening. The Tournament Committee is completely uninvolved in screening.

### Who applies profile badges?

The account support team applies profile badges. While the Tournament Committee can advise for or against doing so based on how a tournament runs and any reports about the tournament, the account support team ultimately applies them.

## How can I help contribute?

You can help the tournament committee by continuing to run excellent tournaments! If you have any issues or concerns regarding any aspect of a community tournament, we encourage you to bring these to our attention via the tournament reports form.

Those who are interested in joining the tournament committee may express their interest by sending an email to the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team) via [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh), where requests are forwarded to the committee. Successful candidates are expected to have a significant breadth of experience in the tournament scene, either as a player or staff.
