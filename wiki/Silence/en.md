# Silence

**Silence** is a term used to describe the punishment of limiting a user's means of communication within the osu! community. Silences can be placed by members of the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) and [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team), and are only placed on users that have broken the [Community Rules](/wiki/Rules).

## Limitations

Users who are silenced cannot do the following:

- Use [chat](/wiki/Client/Interface/Chat_console) (public and private), both in-game and on the website
- Post on any of the osu! forums
- Leave comments anywhere on the website (news, changelog, beatmaps)
- Take part in [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion)
- Edit profile details (e.g. avatar, "me!" section, etc.)
- Submit and update beatmaps
- Partake in [multiplayer](/wiki/Client/Interface/Multiplayer) games

In addition to that, all messages of a silenced user are removed from all chat channels and private conversations.[^chat-cleanup]

After a user is silenced, an alert will be displayed in place of the chat input field, saying when the silence wears off. The silence record can also be observed at the bottom of the profile on the website, from which it will disappear after 28 days.

## Appealing a silence

If you believe you were silenced unfairly, contact the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team#accounts@ppy.sh) at [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) to contest the silence. Make sure to do it from the email linked to your osu! account; mention your osu! username, as well as the approximate date and time when the silence was handed out.

## Common reasons for silences and durations

*Caution: Engaging in "inappropriate behaviour" in private messages is not against the rules, unless said inappropriate behaviour is being delivered to unwilling or unconsenting recipients. If reported, appropriate punishments will be placed.*

| Silence reason | Duration |
| :-- | :-- |
| Spam or inappropriate discussions in chat | 5 minutes |
| Inappropriate comments, beatmap discussion posts, or forum posts | 80 minutes |
| Racism in chat | 80 minutes |
| Inappropriate links or visual content | 43 hours[^exact-duration] |
| Severe misconduct | 43 hours[^exact-duration] |

While these are the most common reasons, silences can last any amount of time between 5 minutes and 28 days if the moderators deem it necessary due to the severity of the offence.

A silence will generally be twice the length of the previous silence unless the current offence is more serious. Silences can stack on top of each other, adding more time for each one.

Please note that if an offence is heavy enough, or if a player is a repeat offender, it may result in an [account restriction](/wiki/Help_centre/Account_restrictions) instead of a silence.

## Notes and references

[^chat-cleanup]: [Blog post by ppy (2012-12-17) "This Week in osu!"](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/38114063519/this-week-in-osu-5)
[^exact-duration]: These silences are technically 42 hours and 40 minutes long due to durations being calculated based on multiples of 5 minutes.
