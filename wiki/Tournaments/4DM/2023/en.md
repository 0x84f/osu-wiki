## Participants

*Participants will be announced soon after the screening phase has ended.*

## Mappools

*Every mappool will be announced 7 days (usually Sunday) before the next stage's match timeline.*

## Ruleset

### Registration

1. In order to be eligible for this tournament:
   1. Player must be within the osu!mania 4-key rank range of #1,000 and #9,999 both when they submit their registration form and until the end of the registration phase.
   2. Player must not have violated the osu! community rules in the past 12 months.
   3. Player must not exceed the global osu!mania rank of #250.
   4. Player must not have been a part of a former winning 4 Digit MWC Team.
   5. Player must not appear on the [Skillbans list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1udZFfvt3it7Hk_k4J89k-UMzY1gfELaBN_oxw53CUOA/edit#gid=757705500). (There may be possibility to appeal their placement on this list. More information on this is given in the [screening phase](#screening-phase) section)
2. To register for this tournament:
   1. Submit the [player registration form](https://forms.gle/hhTmPVZjvbuDx7QSA)
   2. Join the [4DM Discord server](https://discord.gg/W2MQ647) (Failure to join may result in disqualification)

### Screening phase

1. As player will read in the [prizes](#prizes) section, 4DM2023 plans to award the players on top 3 finishing teams with a **unique profile badge**. In order to make this happen, this tournament must meet the requirement of sending osu! staff a list of every player who signs up for this tournament in order for them to be screened for past or current violations of the osu! community rules. If players would like to read more about the screening process and profile badges, it is available through the following [article](/wiki/osu!tourney/Prizes#profile-badges). If in this screening, osu! staff finds that player have violated the osu! community rules in the past 12 months, then we as host sadly will have to deny their registration as eligible to participate in 4DM2023. All players found in violation after the screening will be given time to appeal their stance, and if osu! staff changes their mind on a player's eligibility and notifies a host of this, then they will still be eligible for participation in 4DM2023!
2. Furthermore, there will be a **skill-based restriction system** developed and maintained by ::{ flag=TH }:: [HowToPlayLN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10879600), ::{ flag=FR }:: [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479), and ::{ flag=SG }:: [Polytetral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8612061) in order to keep 4DM2023 fair to all players and as free of malicious sandbagging as possible. To read more about the general scope of this system, please visit the following [article](https://4digitmwc.github.io/skillban-articles/). To see who has been shown to be too skilled for the tournament by this system, visit the [Skillbans list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1udZFfvt3it7Hk_k4J89k-UMzY1gfELaBN_oxw53CUOA/edit#gid=757705500).
3. This list of players shown on the sheet is subject to change until it is announced that the list of signed and barred players has been sent to osu! staff for review. Any player appearing on this list may not sign up for 4DM2023, however there will be an appeal system. If a player is shown as **true** on both the ranked and tournament columns on the above spreadsheet, that player may not appeal their restriction to sign. However if they are only **true** for one or the other, they may message `log.#7606` via Discord with a request to appeal their restriction and a council of tournament staff will deliberate and decide if they should be banned or not. If they have any further questions, please state them in the 4DM's `#questions` text channel in the Discord server.

### Teams

1. Just like the official osu!mania World Cups, 4DM2023 will be a country based team tournament.
   - The country whose team they will play for is determined by the country whose flag is represented on their osu! profile.
   - At the end of the registration and screening phases, a team captain will be picked by the hosts from each country's signup list based on a number of aspects relating to tournament competency.
   - This team captain will pick the members to play alongside them on their country's team. The deadline for captains to submit their countries' teams are by January 5th at 23:59 UTC.
   - Teams will consist of a minimum of 3 members, and a maximum of 6 members per team.

### Structure

#### Qualifiers stage

1. After teams are selected, the first weekend of tournament play will be the qualifiers stage in order to cut down to the top 32 teams that will advance into the Round of 32, as well as to rank said teams in approximate order of skill. There will be a total of eight different qualifier maps, each meant to test a different skillset found in map pools throughout the tournament. The qualifier maps will follow this structure:
   - Stage 1: Slider Velocity (SV)
   - Stage 2: Rice Accuraccy
   - Stage 3: Early Stage Hybrid
   - Stage 4: Long Note Released
   - Stage 5: Long Note Density
   - Stage 6: Late Stage Hybrid
   - Stage 7: Rice Stamina
   - Stage 8: Rice Technical
   - Each of these maps will be custom made by the Map Selection Team and will not be released until approximately one week before the qualifiers stage takes place in order to provide no advantage through familiarity.
2. For the qualifiers stage, each team will play these eight maps in a scheduled boy, going in Stage 1 - 8 order. Teams will present three players to play each map (switching which three play between maps is allowed), and will play each of the qualifier maps up to two times in the lobby. Whichever team score was the highest per stage will be recorded. (For example, if a team scores 975000, 975000, 980000 on one go and then 980000, 985000, 970000 on the next go, the 2nd go will be the one recorded because the total team score was higher on the second go.)
3. Teams will be ranked based on the **score rating** of their qualifier performances, meaning that each teams performance on each of the eight qualifier maps will be ranked compared to every other team and the ranks that each team achieves on these maps will then be added up. The teams will then be sorted based on their score rating from lowest to highest, with lower score ratings being ranked better than higher score ratings. Essentially, a team's qualifier performance is ranked based on how well they perform comparted to every other participating team.

#### Bracket stage

1. After the qualifiers stage, the remaining 32 teams will be placed into a double-elimination bracket in a predetermined order where Rank 1 faces Rank 32, Rank 2 faces Rank 31, etc. (This follows the formula where A and B are placed to face in RO32 if "Team A Rank" + "Team B Rank" = 33.)
2. The number of points needed to win each match as well as the size of the mappool used for the match will vary depending on stage. Mappools will be released approximately one week prior to their respective stages. The details for it are as follows:
   - **Round of 32**: Best-of-9, first to 5 points wins. Mappool consists of 12 FreeMod maps and 1 Tiebreaker map.
   - **Round of 16**: Best-of-9, first to 5 points wins. Mappool consists of 12 FreeMod maps and 1 Tiebreaker map.
   - **Quarterfinals**: Best-of-11, first to 6 points wins. Mappool consists of 14 FreeMod maps and 1 Tiebreaker map.
   - **Semifinals**: Best-of-11, first to 6 points wins. Mappool consists of 14 FreeMod maps and 1 Tiebreaker map.
   - **Finals**: Best-of-13, first to 7 points wins. Mappool consists of 16 FreeMod maps and 1 Tiebreaker map.
   - **Grand Finals**: Best-of-13, first to 7 points wins. Mappool consists of 16 FreeMod maps and 1 Tiebreaker map.

### Match procedures

1. Team captains will be notified of their match via ping on Discord by the referee of their match 30 minutes before the match is scheduled to commence. At this time, team captains shall give the link of one map they wish to play as warmup to the referee of their match. This map must be an osu!mania 4-key map and must be no longer than **4:00**. Referees may refuse a team's warmup and demand another one from the team captain if the map doesn't meet these guidelines or is found to be offensive. Failure to provide a warmup to the referee at this time mayu result in this team skipping their warmup map.
2. Team captains will be invited to their match lobby by a referee no less than **5:00** before the match is scheduled to commence. In the time before the match, team captains will invite and gather their teams into the lobby.
3. When both team members have 3 members present in the lobby, the match will commence by each team playing their selected warmup.
4. After warmups, both team captains will do `!roll` command in the lobby chat. The captain who rolls the higher number is the "Roll Winner" and the captain who rolls the lower number is the "Roll Loser". This will decide the order of protects, bans, and picks as laid out below:
   - Roll Winner will choose one map from the FreeMod pool to Protect from being banned.
   - Roll Loser will choose one map from the FreeMod pool to Protect from being banned.
   - Roll Loser will choose one map from the FreeMod pool to Ban.
   - Roll Winner will choose one map from the FreeMod pool to Ban.
   - Roll Winner will choose one map from the FreeMod pool to Pick.
5. Teams will have **two minutes** to pick a beatmap and **two minutes** to get ready.
6. After each map concludes, the team with the highest team score on the map will be awarded one point. Picks will alternate between team captains until a winner is decided by being the first to get the required amount of points to win that round.
7. If both teams tie at match points, the Tiebreaker map will be played, the team who wins the Tiebreaker map will win the match.
8. Each team will receive one "tactical timeout" of **two minutes** to be used as extra time to pick a beatmap. The tactical timeout may only be used by the team who has to pick.
9. If a Tiebreaker gets played, both teams may use their tactical timeout, but only one timeout can be given.
10. Matches will be played with `TeamVS` mode on `Score V2`.
11. The Red Team will occupy slots 1 - 3, and the Blue Team will occupy slots 4 - 6.
12. Allowed mods in the FreeMod pool are NoFail, Hidden, FadeIn, Flashlight, and Mirror. The tiebreaker map is also played under FreeMod conditions.
13. Teams have a maximum of 3 minutes after the conclusion of the previous map to pick another map from the freemod pool to play (and are expected to pick in 2 minutes or less). If a team takes longer than 3 minutes to do so, a random beatmap from the freemod pool will be picked for them by the match referee.
14. If a player disconnects during a match, their score is counted as a failed score. However, if this disconnect happens before 30 seconds of the map is played, the referee can decide to let the teams rematch. If this rematch happens, the rosters on both teams must stay the same unless the disconnected player cannot return to the lobby, in which case both teams are allowed to switch rosters.
15. Failed scores do not count toward a team's total score, however a score which fails and then revives will still count. (Use NoFail if you believe you are in jeopardy of failing a map!)
16. If team scores are an exact tie at the conclusion of a map, the map will be replayed.
17. If a team cannot gather 3 members into the match lobby by 10 minutes after the match’s scheduled start time, the opposing team will be declared a win by default. If neither team can gather 3 members into the match lobby by 10 minutes after the match’s scheduled start time, the team with the higher seed out of qualifiers will be declared a win by default.
18. If a player disconnects in the middle of a match and the team cannot provide a replacement, the match can be delayed by up to 10 minutes before a win by default is declared to the opposing team.
19. For additional rules left out of this section of the forum, please see the [Additional Rules](#additional-rules) section below. As well, feel free to ask a host about any questions regarding rules or the tournament in general!

### Additional rules

NOTE: Staff will attempt to closely follow the rules of [the most recent 4K osu!mania World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K).

1. The tournament hosts are responsible for scheduling all matches and informing players of when they are scheduled to play. If a team is unhappy with when they are scheduled by the hosts to play, they have the option to reschedule their match as late as the end of Thursday of the week before the weekend of their match. Instructions on how to do so will be provided in the Discord server.
2. Please note that while the organizers will try to schedule all matches for the best possible time for both teams, timezone conflicts may force some matches to occur in the early mornings or late nights.
3. If no referee is available to referee a match, the match shall be delayed.
4. If no streamers are available to broadcast the match, the match will still happen without being broadcasted.
5. If no commentators are available to commentate the match but broadcasters are available to broadcast the match, the match will still be broadcasted but without commentary. Please note that while we will try to broadcast every match, we may be unable to due to overlapping matches and/or lack of streamer availability.
6. Rescheduled matches will be prioritized under non-rescheduled matches in terms of being broadcasted.
7. Each respective stage of the tournament is to be completed in a single weekend, using the same map pool for the entire weekend. Weekday matches are allowed if both team captains agree to them and they take place before the weekend of that scheduled stage. As aforementioned, map pools will be released roughly a week before the stage they are to be played on. The latest a map in a released map pool may be slightly updated (for example, as to fixing a notable timing or snapping issue) is by 23:59 UTC of the Monday after the map pool is released.
8. If one player on a team has their account restricted while still participating in the tournament for reasons of believed cheating, multi accounting, or anything else, this player's entire team shall be disqualified from the tournament with no exceptions. Depending on the case, the team most recently defeated in a match by the newly disqualified team may be allowed to advance in this disqualified team's place. If this happens, the result of this former match will be voided.
9. Repeated and excessive toxic behavior toward any staff member, player, or spectator either in match multiplayer chatroom, the official discord server, or the official twitch channel chatroom is strictly prohibited and will lead to, in successive order with host’s discretion to skip certain steps:
   1. Casual, undocumented warning
   2. Formal, documented warning
   3. Timeout of player wherever necessary for a subjective amount of time (Players on timeout during tournament match will be disallowed to play during their match and must be swapped out for other players)
   4. Official ban from the tournament as well as a ban from the official Discord server and Twitch channel
