## Ruleset

### Tournament rules

1. The GB Cup 2023 Autumn is a captain draft-based team tournament, played on the `osu!mania` game mode.
   - While this competition is planned as a 3 versus 3 setup, this might change depending on the number of incoming registrations.
2. The GB Cup 2023 Autumn is divided into three stages: qualifier, regular phase and elimination phase.
3. Beatmap scoring is based on `Score V2`.
4. The maps for each round will be announced by the mappool selectors on the official stream, on the Sunday before the actual matches take place.
5. The match schedules for each round will be announced by the host on this page, as well as the information sheet, on the Sunday before the matches take place.
6. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins is allowed.
   - Custom skin elements must not be used to alter core gameplay mechanics.
7. If a game ends in a draw, it will be nullified and the map will be replayed.
8. Teams may ask for a rematch if a team member encounters technical difficulties while playing.
   - "Lag spikes" will not be considered as a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
   - If a rematch happens, the original roster for each team during that particular beatmap must remain the same. If that is not possible, e.g. by virtue of a technical issue, *both* teams will be allowed to swap rosters.
   - This rule should not to be abused. Referees may veto a rematch request if they find that this is the case.
9. Disconnects within 30 seconds or 25% of the beatmap length (whichever happens first) can be rematched, at the referee's discretion, as long as it is clearly communicated in the chatroom.
   - Each player may only request to rematch **one beatmap** in a match with this rule. This rule should not be abused; the referee has the right to deny the request at their own discretion.
10. If a player disconnects, their scores will not be counted towards their team's total, unless adequate proof of said score is provided. The following are considered as acceptable proof:
    - Player point-of-view live stream snippets (commonly referred to as "clips" or "VODs"). The entirety of the play, along with the results screen must be clearly visible along with the affected player's score.
    - Replay files of the play, taken directly from the "Local scores" tab on the affected player's client (the timestamps must exactly match the time at which the game took place, as seen on the multiplayer lobby link).
    - Screenshots from other players taken directly in-game that show the affected player's score.
      - Screenshots from the results screen must clearly show the affected player's score. This is the preferred method.
      - Screenshots taken in-game at the time of disconnection may be accepted. Note that this method does not provide a one-to-one representation of that player's score. Using this method is not encouraged and it may be denied at the referee's discretion if the information provided is not sufficient to identify the player/score.
      - All screenshots **MUST** be taken using the game itself (using `Shift` + `F12`), that is, they must be hosted on the `https://osu.ppy.sh/` domain. Any other form of screenshot will be denied.
      - Player scores may be derived from the official stream as a last resort, in cases where the match is streamed.
11. If less than the minimum amount of required players are present at match time,  the match can be postponed for up to 10 minutes. If, after this period, there are still not enough players for either, a *win by default* will be declared for the team with the most members present.
    - The minimum amount of required players is the amount of players needed to play a beatmap without any vacant spots in the lobby (i.e. 3 participants must be present for the match to begin).
12. Exchanging players during games is allowed without limitations, except tournament-specific rules. See the [match instructions](#match-procedures) for details.
13. **The size for a team is 5.**
    - This might change depending on the amount of registrations.
14. Players are expected to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Excessive match delays from the players' side may result in penalties being applied at the referee's discretion. Disrupting the match by foul play, insulting or provoking other players or staff, delaying the match, or other deliberate inappropriate misbehaviour are strictly prohibited, and will be punished accordingly, the referee has the final interpretation of the match.
15. All players and staff must be treated with respect. Instructions of the referees and the host are to be followed. Decisions labelled as final are not to be objected.
16. The multiplayer chatrooms underlie the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules). All chat rules apply to the multiplayer chatrooms, too.
    - Breaking the chat rules results in a silence. Silenced players cannot participate in multiplayer matches and must be exchanged for the time being.
17. Unexpected incidences will be handled by the host. Referees may allow higher tolerance depending on the given circumstances. This is up to their discretion.
18. Penalties for violating the tournament rules include, but are not limited to:
    - Exclusion of specific players for one beatmap.
    - Exclusion of specific players for an entire match.
    - Declaring the match as forfeited, or as a win by default for the other team.
    - Disqualification from the entire tournament.
    - Disqualification from current and future GBC series.
    - Disqualification from current and future official and community tournaments, until appealed.
19. Referees may allow, at their discretion, lower or higher tolerances for timers.
20. The host may request liveplays or recordings of individual players or teams at any point.
21. The host reserves the right to modify these rules at any moment. Any such changes will be announced in advance.
22. According to the rules of Official Tournament support, for the players that suspected to have behaviors like "sandbagging" or "fake match", the host have rights to raise the issue to the Tournament Committee for a case-by-case review.

3. Both captains will alternate picking a beatmap from the mappool.
4. Each captain must use `!roll` once in `#multiplayer`.
   - The winner of the `!roll` could choose to pick first or ban first of the match. The other choose will be used by loser team. First pick team will also protect first, the others will ban first.
5. After each pick, both captains **may** ban **one** of the opposing team members from playing the beatmap in a match, **except during tiebreakers**. A player cannot be banned during a match until they have played one beatmap.
   - Any player can only be banned like this **once** per match.
   - Only players who have already played in the match can be banned.
   - The team that picks beatmaps first cannot ban players during the first 2 rounds.
     - As a consequence of the earlier rules, no teams are allowed to ban players during the first round since no one has finished playing any beatmaps.
   - Map picking and ban should be sent in the same message, if the ban is delayed, or the message cause a disagreement or misunderstanding, the referee has the right to ignore the ban.
6. Teams will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and ban an opposing player, and 2 minutes to get ready.

   - No matter which team needs to timeout after pick map, it can only allowed with the consent of both captains.
7. If a team takes more time than allowed, the procedures adopted will be as follows:
   - Picking beatmaps and banning players should be sent **using a single message**. If a team continues to be slow at banning, referees have rights to **ignore the ban**.
   - For the first occurrence:
     - The team will receive a verbal warning from the referee.
   - On subsequent occurrences:
     - For bans of opposing players, the captain forfeits the ban.
     - For map bans, the captain forfeits the ban.
     - For map picks, a random map will be chosen from the mappool using `!roll X`, where X is the number of maps that were neither picked nor banned, excluding the tiebreaker.
     - For a ready timer, the referee will issue the `!mp start 10` command, regardless of how many players from each team are present in the lobby, using `!mp kick` on any extra players for each team, starting from the top (i.e. the first valid player combination for each team will be forced to play the pick). The results for such games are to be taken as is.
   - Repeat offenders may receive further sanctions from the host.
8. Each team will receive **one** "tactical timeout" of **two minutes**, to be used as extra time to pick or ban a beatmap. *The tactical timeout is optional.*
   - The tactical timeout may be called on a tiebreaker, provided that both teams' captains agree to it.
