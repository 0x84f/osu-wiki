## Ruleset

### Tournament rules

1. The GB Cup 2024 Autumn is a captain draft–based team tournament, played in the osu!mania game mode.
   - While this competition is planned as a 3 versus 3 setup, this might change depending on the number of incoming registrations.
2. The GB Cup 2024 Autumn is divided into three stages: Qualifier, the regular phase and the elimination phase.
3. Beatmap scoring is based on Score V2.
4. The maps for each round will be announced by the mappool selectors on the official stream, on the Sunday before the actual matches take place.
5. The match schedules for each round will be announced by the host on this page, as well as the information sheet, on the Sunday before the matches take place.
6. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins is allowed.
   - Custom skin elements must not be used to alter core gameplay mechanics.
7. If a game ends in a draw, it will be nullified and the map will be replayed.
8. Teams may ask for a rematch if a team member encounters technical difficulties while playing.
   - "Lag spikes" will not be considered as a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
   - If a rematch happens, the original roster for each team during that particular beatmap must remain the same. If that is not possible, e.g. by virtue of a technical issue, *both* teams will be allowed to swap rosters.
   - This rule should not to be abused. Referees may veto a rematch request if they find that this is the case.
9. Disconnects within 30 seconds or 25% of the beatmap length (whichever happens first) can be rematched, at the referee's discretion, as long as it is clearly communicated in the chatroom.
   - Each player may only request to rematch **one beatmap** in a match with this rule. This rule should not be abused; the referee has the right to deny the request at their own discretion.
10. If a player disconnects, their scores will not be counted towards their team's total, unless adequate proof of said score is provided. The following are considered as acceptable proof:
    - Player point-of-view live stream snippets (commonly referred to as "clips" or "VODs"). The entirety of the play, along with the results screen must be clearly visible along with the affected player's score.
    - Replay files of the play, taken directly from the "Local scores" tab on the affected player's client (the timestamps must exactly match the time at which the game took place, as seen on the multiplayer lobby link).
    - Screenshots from other players taken directly in-game that show the affected player's score.
      - Screenshots from the results screen must clearly show the affected player's score. This is the preferred method.
      - Screenshots taken in-game at the time of disconnection may be accepted. Note that this method does not provide a one-to-one representation of that player's score. Using this method is not encouraged and it may be denied at the referee's discretion if the information provided is not sufficient to identify the player/score.
      - All screenshots **MUST** be taken using the game itself (using `Shift` + `F12`), that is, they must be hosted on the `https://osu.ppy.sh/` domain. Any other form of screenshot will be denied.
      - Player scores may be derived from the official stream as a last resort, in cases where the match is streamed.
11. If less than the minimum amount of required players are present at match time, the match can be postponed for up to 10 minutes. If, after this period, there are still not enough players for either, a *win by default* will be declared for the team with the most members present.
    - The minimum amount of required players is the amount of players needed to play a beatmap without any vacant spots in the lobby (i.e. 3 participants must be present for the match to begin).
12. Exchanging players during games is allowed without limitations, except tournament-specific rules. See the [match instructions](#match-procedures) for details.
13. **The size for a team is 5.**
    - This might change depending on the amount of registrations.
14. Players are expected to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Excessive match delays from the players' side may result in penalties being applied at the referee's discretion. Disrupting the match by foul play, insulting or provoking other players or staff, delaying the match, or other deliberate inappropriate misbehaviour are strictly prohibited, and will be punished accordingly at the interpretation of the referee.
15. All players and staff must be treated with respect. Instructions of the referees and the host are to be followed. Decisions labelled as final are not to be objected.
16. The multiplayer chatrooms underlie the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules). All chat rules apply to the multiplayer chatrooms, too.
    - Breaking the chat rules results in a silence. Silenced players cannot participate in multiplayer matches and must be exchanged for the time being.
17. Unexpected incidences will be handled by the host. Referees may allow higher tolerance depending on the given circumstances. This is up to their discretion.
18. Penalties for violating the tournament rules include, but are not limited to:
    - Exclusion of specific players for one beatmap.
    - Exclusion of specific players for an entire match.
    - Declaring the match as forfeited, or as a win by default for the other team.
    - Disqualification from the entire tournament.
    - Disqualification from current and future GBC series.
    - Disqualification from current and future official and community tournaments, until appealed.
19. Referees may allow, at their discretion, lower or higher tolerances for timers.
20. The host may request liveplays or recordings of individual players or teams at any point.
21. The host reserves the right to modify these rules at any moment. Any such changes will be announced in advance.
22. Players who are suspected of undermining the competitive integrity of the tournament, such as by *sandbagging* or *match fixing*, may be reported to the [Tournament Committee](/wiki/People/Tournament_Committee) for case-by-case review.

### Tournament registration

1. Please fill [**this form**](https://wj.qq.com/s2/15516394/012b/) to register.
   - Players need to choose a division according to their chat software, i.e. the Discord division or QQ division. The QQ division and Discord division will each have an independent tournament, but use same mappool.
   - Players **must** join [this QQ group](https://jq.qq.com/?_wv=1027&k=zqBeTqMW) or [this Discord server](https://discord.gg/kR4hJnPs) after register, according to their choice during registration.
   - Players **must** state their time zone when registering.
2. To ensure valid and serious registrations, every registered user will be manually checked by the host.
   - To be successfully registered, a player must not have violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) within the last 12 months.
   - **There are no rank limitations for this tournament.** If there are too many registrants, some of the high-level registrants may be removed from the main tournament and be invited to participate in the showmatch instead.
3. A list of all successfully registered players will be published after the registration phase, and will then participate in the drafting phase.
4. [Tournament staff members](/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support#staff) must not participate as players in the tournament.

### Qualifier instructions

1. In the Qualifier stage, all players will play a specific mappool designed by the mappool selectors and mappool helpers.
   - All players will be ranked in the Qualifier together. Based on the total number of applicants, the organiser will allow a number of top players from the Qualifiers to enter the drafting phase, and the other players will be eliminated. If a qualified player quits, they may be replaced by someone else.
2. The Qualifier mappool contains 8 maps, all of which will use [FreeMod](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#free-mod) rules, organised as such:
   - Rice: 3 beatmaps
   - LN 2 beatmaps
   - Hybrid: 2 beatmaps
   - SV: 1 beatmap
3. Players will play the mappool at least once (and up to twice) at a designated time. Their best combined score, meaning the total of each beatmap's best score, will be the final result.
4. The mappool will be played in the following order: SV1, RC1, RC2, RC3, LN1, LN2, HB1, HB2. Players may not ask to play the pool in any other order.
   - Player may skip playing any beatmap on their second run.
5. There will be an optional 5-minute break in between the first and second playthrough of the mappool.
6. We suggest players not to broadcast or share their results to avoid seed manipulation.
7. Qualifier stage results will be used for seeding and for choosing captains.
   - Higher scores lead to a higher chance to be picked during the drafting phase. Players are eliminated if they do not get picked, or if they get too low of a score during Qualifers.
8. Some best-performance players will advance to drafting phase.
   - Disrupting the match by foul play or seed manipulation will result in disqualification, and any such players will be announced before the drafting phase takes place.
9. Players will use same multiplayer rooms if they select same time to play the Qualifiers. It is prohibited to abort a match with the reason of a technical problem, in which case the score will be recorded as is.

### Stage instructions

1. Following the Qualifier stage, all players will participate in a phase to form teams, called the *drafting phase*. Both divisions will have independent drafting phases. All unpicked players will be eliminated from the tournament.
2. Following the drafting phase, a Swiss stage will be played in both zones, called the *regular stage*. Teams from the two divisions will play 6 rounds of the Swiss round to determine 8 teams each to advance to the knockout round, with the other teams eliminated.
3. Following the regular stage, a single-elimination stage will be played in both divisions.
4. All teams that lose in the knockout rounds will be eliminated from the tournament and the last team will be the winner.

### Drafting phase instructions

1. The host will declare one captain for each team 24 hours before the drafting phase.
   - Drafting order will also be declared by the host.
   - Captains are selected by performance and preference.
   - Non-captains will join a group of players waiting to join a team, herein called a "player pool".
   - The drafting phase for the two divisions will be held separately, and the number of teams will be determined by the number of players who have passed the Qualifier round in corresponding division.
2. Captains decide their team members during the drafting phase.
3. There will be a 120-second planning phase before the picking phase starts.
4. During the picking phase, the pick order consists of 2 phases that repeat twice, such that every captain gets to choose 4 players.
   - During phase 1 and 3, picks start in *increasing* order, from the 1st to the 24th captain.
   - During phase 2 and 4, picks start in *decreasing* order, from the 24th to the 1st captain.
   - *This might change depending on the number of incoming registrations.*
5. Each captain has 60 seconds to pick one player from the player pool on their turn.
   - If the captain does not pick a player within 60 seconds, a random player from the remaining player pool will be assigned to their team.
6. If the captain picks a player, the pick time still has to elapse before the next captain's turn starts.
7. After each phase, there is a 60-second break before the next phase starts.
8. At all times, the captains may communicate with each other via multiplayer chatrooms or voice chat.
   - Other players will be muted during the drafting phase.
9. After the drafting phase, captains may choose, with the approval of the host, to delegate their role to other prospective team members.
10. Captains may also choose to rename their team name after the drafting phase.
    - The default name of team is: `Team {X}`, with `{X}` being an abbreviation of the captain's name.
    - Team names cannot be longer than **24** characters (a Chinese character is considered as 2).
11. Bad behaviour during the drafting phase will be seen as disrupting the match by foul play.
12. To prevent draft manipulation, players are strictly prohibited from contacting captains before the draft phase.

### Regular phase instructions

1. The regular phase will be divided into two divisions, the Discord division and the QQ division.
   - Players can choose the division and participate in the team of the corresponding division. Players must ensure that they can use the chat tool of the corresponding division and keep the chat open.
2. Following the drafting phase, two 3-round Swiss stages will be played. This means teams with same match record will face each other.
   - The number of teams in each division to enter the elimination phase is 8 or 4, which depends on the number of registrations.
   - Every 3-round Swiss stage will eliminate half of the teams. Teams that win twice will advance, and teams that lose twice will be eliminated. If a team wins in the first 2 rounds, then they will skip the 3rd round.
3. The final ranking of the Swiss round will be determined by the following criteria in order:
   - Most matches won
   - Highest beatmap difference (`beatmap wins - beatmap losses`)
   - Highest Buchholz score[^bu]
   - Head-to-head result (if possible)
   - Most beatmaps won
   - Fewest beatmaps lost
   - Sum of all score differences of each beatmap (`∑(total score - opponent's total score)` for each beatmap played in the regular stage)
   - Dice roll
4. The top 8 teams will advanced to the knockout stage, while the remaining players get eliminated from the tournament.
5. The results from the regular stage will also be used for seeding teams.

### Win conditions

- In the Qualifier stage, players need to rank high enough to advance.
- In the drafting phase, players need to be picked into a team or become captains to advance.
- In the regular stage Swiss I, teams need to win 5 maps to win a match (best of 9).
- In the regular stage Swiss II, teams need to win 6 maps to win a match (best of 11).
- In Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and Finals, teams need to win 7 maps to win a match (best of 13).

### Match procedures

1. A referee will create a multiplayer room 10 minutes before the scheduled match time. Players must join the lobby in that period.
   - The room settings are `Game mode: "osu!mania"`, `Team mode: "Team Vs"` and `Score mode: "ScoreV2"`. The room name must follow the pattern of `GBC 2024 Autumn: ({TeamRed}) vs ({TeamBlue})`.
   - The team mentioned first in the room name must be the red team, and the team mentioned second in the room name must be the blue team.
2. Each captain can protect **one beatmap** from the pool. These beatmaps cannot be banned. Then, each captain can ban **one beatmap** from the pool. These beatmaps cannot be picked by any team for the entire duration of the match.
3. Both captains will alternate picking a beatmap from the mappool.
4. Each captain must use `!roll` once in `#multiplayer`.
   - The winner of the `!roll` may choose to pick first or ban first in the match. The other choice will be used by loser of the roll. The team who picks first will also protect first, and the others will ban first.
5. After each pick, both captains **may** ban **one** of the opposing team members from playing the beatmap in a match, **except during tiebreakers**.
   - Any player can only be banned like this **once** per match.
   - Only players who have already played in the match can be banned.
   - The team that picks beatmaps first cannot ban players during the first 2 rounds.
     - As a consequence of the earlier rules, no teams are allowed to ban players during the first round since no one has finished playing any beatmaps.
   - Picks and bans should be sent in the same message. If the ban is delayed, or the message causes a disagreement or misunderstanding, the referee has the right to ignore the ban.
6. Teams will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and ban an opposing player, and 2 minutes to get ready.
   - A team can request a timeout when they are picking a map. The timeout lasts 2 minutes and will be used after the map pick timer.
   - No matter which team needs to timeout after their pick, it can only allowed with the consent of both captains.
   - The tactical timeout may be called on a tiebreaker.
7. If a team takes more time than allowed, the procedures adopted will be as follows:
   - For the first occurrence:
     - The team will receive a verbal warning from the referee.
   - On subsequent occurrences:
     - For bans of opposing players, the captain forfeits the ban.
     - For map bans, the captain forfeits the ban.
     - For map picks, a random map will be chosen from the mappool using `!roll X`, where X is the number of maps that were neither picked nor banned, excluding the tiebreaker.
     - For a ready timer, the referee will issue the `!mp start 10` command, regardless of how many players from each team are present in the lobby, using `!mp kick` on any extra players for each team, starting from the top (i.e. the first valid player combination for each team will be forced to play the pick). The results for such games are to be taken as is.
   - Repeat offenders may receive further sanctions from the host.

### Mappool instructions

1. There will be six separate mappools.
2. Each mappool consists of a fixed amount of maps each stage which will all be played under [FreeMod](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#free-mod) conditions. This means that there is a unique FreeMod bracket.
3. The mappool sizes are as follows:
   - Qualifiers: 8 beatmaps
   - Mappool in the regular phase: 15 beatmaps
   - Mappool in the elimination phase: 17 beatmaps.
4. Each mappool has one tiebreaker, except for the Qualifiers. The tiebreaker will be played under FreeMod conditions.
5. Possible mod choices for the FreeMod bracket are `NoFail`, `Hidden`, `Fade In`, `Flashlight`, and `Mirror`.
6. Mappools for each week are structured as follows:

| Stage | Mappool |
| :-- | :-- |
| Swiss I week 1 | A |
| Swiss I week 2 & 3 | B |
| Swiss II week 1 | C |
| Swiss II week 2 & 3 | D |
| Knockout week 1 | E |
| Knockout week 2 | F |
