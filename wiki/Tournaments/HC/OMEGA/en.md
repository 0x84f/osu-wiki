## Ruleset

### General

1. This tournament is broken up into 3 divisions of player versus player (this is discussed more in the [tournament staging](#tournament-staging) section), with a single-elimination bracket.
2. The scoring system used will be **ScoreV2**.
3. This tournament is an **osu!** tournament.
4. Match scheduling is decided by the organisers. Players may feel free to ask for a reschedule if the given schedule conflicts with the player. If a reschedule is approved, it may not be streamed or recorded due to staff availability.
5. If there is no referee available, the match may be postponed.
6. If both players tie on a map, the map will be replayed again, if the players tie once again, the map will be nullified, and the player who picked the map will be able to pick a new one: in the case that there is no map other than the one already played, there will be a brief break and the map will be replayed, once more.
7. If a player disconnects from the game, the opposite player will get a point, this is nullified if a player disconnects within **30 seconds** of the map beginning, in which the map will be restarted. Any deliberate abuse of this rule will be penalised and is up to the tournament's staff.
8. Players have **10 minutes** to show up to their scheduled match. A referee will ping the two players 15 minutes before their scheduled match time through osu! private message and through discord.
9. If the opponent fails to show up, the player who does show up automatically advances.
   - If both players fail to show up, the player with the higher seed will advance.

11. Any other rule change(s) or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the discord. Please pay attention.

2. During the Qualifiers Stage there will be multiple lobbies open for sign-ups. Please make sure to sign up for a time that best fits your schedule.
3. The Qualifiers Stage is used to help get rid of those who don't show up and to get the participation count to the nice number of 64.
4. There will be no warmups for the Qualifiers and Group Heats stages, remember this is a *Harumachi Clover* tournament, the maps are only 40 seconds at most.
5. Seeding will be gathered by taking the highest score recorded and used in comparison to the scores of the other players.

### Lobby specifics

1. A private match will be created for the matches. The players will be invited to the asscociated match around 15 minutes before the match time. Make sure to have PMs enabled for everyone not just on your friend's list as the invite does **not** bypass this setting. If you are unable to make it to the match due to this issue, your position in the tournament is **not** guaranteed.
2. During the 1v1 Bracket, each player will `!roll`, the winner of the roll **picks who will pick the first map**. Tournament staff would like to preface, that if you win the `!roll`, this does **not** mean you pick the first map, this means you pick whether you pick the first map or your opponent does. Choose wisely!
3. For the Qualifiers and Group Heats stage, **the mappool will be played through twice**.
4. Players will be allowed to ask for a brief break at the end of the first run-through of the mappool.
5. There are **no** bans.
6. There are **no** warmups. Be prepared.
7. 1v1 Bracket only: In case of a tie, the tiebreaker will be played.
   - Otherwise, see: [Number 6](#ruleset).
