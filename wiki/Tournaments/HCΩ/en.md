## Ruleset

### General

1. This tournament is broken up into 3 divisions of player versus player (this is discussed more in [stages](#stage)), with a single-elimination bracket.
2. The scoring system used will be **ScoreV2**.
3. This tournament is an **osu!standard** tournament.
4. Match scheduling is decided by the organizers. Players may feel free to ask for a reschedule if the given schedule conflicts with the player. If a reschedule is approved, it may not be streamed or recorded due to staff availability.
5. If there is no referee available, the match may be postponed.
6. If both players tie on a map, the map will be replayed again, if the players tie once again, the map will be nullified, and th eplayer who picked the map will be able to pick a new one: in the case that there is no map other than the one already played, there will be a brief break and the map will be replayed, once more.
7. If a player disconnects from the game, the opposite player will get a point, this is nullified if a player disconnects within **30 seconds** of the map beginning, in which the map will be restarted. Any deliberate abuse of this rule will be penalised and is up to the tournament's staff.
8. Players have **10 minutes** to show up to their scheduled match. If the opponent failed to show up, the player who showed up automatically advances forward.

2. During the 1v1 Bracket, each player will `!roll`, the winner of the roll **picks who will pick the first map**.

5. 1v1 Bracket only: In case of a tie, the tiebreaker will be played.

## History

Their was two reditions of **Harumachi Cup** before **Harumachi Cup Ω** dubbed: *Harumachi Clover Cup* and *Harumachi Cup 2*, respectively. Just like **Harumachi Cup Ω** the previous tournaments by the same namesake only included beatmaps that were mapped to the song, "Harumachi Clover".

### Harumachi Clover Cup
