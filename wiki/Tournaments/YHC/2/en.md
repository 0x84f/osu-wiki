## Ruleset

### General

1. The Yuyuko's Hidden Cup Season 2 is a entertainment-oriented double elimination 3v3 team tournament, played on the osu! game mode.
2. Beatmap scoring is based on ScoreV2.
3. Based on the number of registration, **the size for a team is 5 players**.
4. The beatmap list for each next round will be announced by the mappool selectors on the official live stream, on the weekend (Friday 12:00 - Monday 23:00) after the matches take place.
5. The default match schedules for each round will be announced by the tournament managers in the information (main) sheet, on Sunday before the last matches take place. the captain could have a discussion with the opponent and confirm the match time, before Saturday 00:00 in the week.
6. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
   - Custom skin elements must not be used to alter core gameplay elements or mechanics in unintended ways.
7. If less than the minimum amount of required players are present at match time, the match can be postponed for up to 10 minutes. If after this period there are still not enough players for either team, a win by default will be declared for the side with the most members present.
   - The minimum amount of required players is the amount of players needed to play a beatmap without any vacant spots in the lobby (i.e. 3 participants must be present for the match to begin). 
8. Exchanging players between games is allowed without limitations.
9. If a game ends in a draw, it will be nullified and the beatmap will be replayed.
10. Teams may ask for a rematch if a team member encounters technical issues while playing within 30 seconds or 25% of the beatmap drain length (whichever happens first) of the game's start. Referees may, at their discretion, veto this request.
    - "Lag spikes" are not considered a valid reason to rematch a beatmap.
    - The roster for each team during a rematch must remain the same as the original run. If that is not possible, e.g. by virtue of a technical issue that prevents a player from entering the lobby, both teams will be allowed to swap rosters.
    - This rule is not to be abused. Referees may veto a rematch request if they find that this is the case.
11. If a player disconnects mid-game, their scores will not be counted towards their team's total, unless adequate proof of said score is provided. The following are considered as acceptable proof:
    - Player point-of-view live stream snippets (commonly referred to as "clips" or "VODs"). The entirety of the play, along with the results screen must be clearly visible along with the affected player's score.
    - Replay files of the play, taken directly from the "Local scores" tab on the affected player's client (the timestamps must exactly match the time at which the game took place, as seen on the multiplayer lobby link).
    - Screenshots from other players taken directly in-game that show the affected player's score.
      - Screenshots from the results screen must clearly show the affected player's score. This is the preferred method.
      - Screenshots taken in-game at the time of disconnection may be accepted. Note that this method does not provide a one-to-one representation of that player's score. Using this method is not encouraged and it may be denied at the referee's discretion if the information provided is not sufficient to identify the player/score.
      - All screenshots **MUST** be taken using the game itself (using `Shift` + `F12`), that is, they must be hosted on the `https://osu.ppy.sh/` domain. Any other form of screenshot will be denied.
    - Player scores may be derived from the official stream as a last resort, in cases where the match is streamed.
12. Players are expected to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Excessive match delays from the players' side may result in penalties being applied by the tournament managers. Disrupting the match by foul play, insulting or provoking other players or staff, delaying the match, or other deliberate inappropriate misbehaviour are strictly prohibited, and will be punished accordingly.
13. All players and staff must be treated with respect. Instructions from the referees and the tournament managers are to be followed. Decisions labelled as final are not to be objected.
14. The multiplayer chatrooms underlie the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules). All chat rules apply to the multiplayer chatrooms where the matches will take place.
    - Breaking the chat rules may result in a silence. Silenced players cannot participate in multiplayer matches and must be exchanged for the duration of the punishment.
15. Penalties for violating the tournament rules include, but are not limited to:
    - Exclusion of specific players for one beatmap.
    - Exclusion of specific players for an entire match.
    - Declaring the match as forfeited, or as a win by default for the other team.
    - Disqualification from the entire tournament.
    - Disqualification from the current and future official tournaments, until appealed.
16. Referees may allow, at their discretion, lower or higher tolerances for timers.
17. The tournament managers may request liveplays or recordings of individual players or teams at any point in the tournament without prior warning.
18. The tournament managers reserve the right to modify these rules at any moment. Any such changes will be announced in advance.

The team mentioned first in the room name must be the red team, the team mentioned second in the room name must be the blue team.

2. Each team may ban **one beatmap** to be selected from the pool In all stages of the tournament. These beatmaps may not be picked by any team for the entire duration of the match.

3. Each captain must use `!roll` once in the match's chatroom.
   - The winner of the `!roll`, the team captain would decide if their team **picks** first or **bans** first.
   - Teams may "double pick" (i.e. pick two or more maps from the same mod pool in sequence) without limitations.

   - For the first occurrence:
     - The team will receive a verbal warning from the referee
   - On subsequent occurrences:
     - For a pick timer: a random map will be chosen from the mappool using `!roll X`, where X is the number of beatmaps that were neither picked nor banned, excluding the tiebreaker.
     - For a ready timer: the referee will issue the `!mp start 10` command, regardless of how many players from each team are present in the lobby, using `!mp kick` on any extra players for each team, starting from the top (i.e. the first valid player combination for each team will be forced to play the pick). The results for such games are to be taken as is.
     - Repeat offenders may receive further sanctions from the tournament managers.
6. Each team will receive one "tactical timeout" of 2 minutes, to be used as extra time to pick or ban a beatmap. *The tactical timeout is optional.*
   - The tactical timeout may be called on a tiebreaker, provided that both teams' captains agree to it.

### Mappool information

1. Every stage will have its own mappool.
2. Each mappool will consist of 4 brackets: [No Mod](/wiki/Game_modifier#nomod), [Hidden](/wiki/Game_modifier/Hidden), [Double Time](/wiki/Game_modifier/Double_Time), and [FreeMod](/wiki/Game_modifier#freemod).
3. The mappool sizes are as follows:
   - Group Stage (Round 1) and Elimination Stage 1 (Round 2): 14 beatmaps: 6 HD, 2 NM, 2 DT, 3 FM, 1 TB
   - Elimination Stage 2 (Round 3): 16 beatmaps: 7 HD, 2 NM, 3 DT, 3 FM, 1 TB
4. The Hidden and Double Time brackets will be played with the respective mods enabled for all players.
   - It's possible if a player uses Hidden mod during the Double Time mod bracket.
5. The No Fail mod will be enforced on every beatmap.

   - Possible mod choices are Hidden, Hard Rock, and Hidden + Hard Rock.
   - **When playing a FreeMod beatmap, there must be 1 player with Hidden ONLY and at least 2 players with a Mod. For the remaining player, enabling mods is optional.**
