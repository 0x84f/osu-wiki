## Ruleset

Any disregard for these rules will be met with punishment, ranging from a warning to immediate disqualification. It will be up to the discretion of the staff to punish based on the severity of the offence. **These rules and regulations are subject to change during the event.**

### Qualifier lobby procedure (osu! only)

- All players will play in a qualifier lobby and play through every map in the qualifier mappool.
- After each map, each player is given points based on their placing compared to all other players.
- The 16 players with the highest total points will advance to the bracket stage, where seeding is determined by said points.

### Bracket lobby procedure

Both tournaments will use a standard double-elimination format for playoffs.

- No warmups.
- Each player has 1 ban.
- The player with the higher `!roll` chooses to ban or pick first; the player with the lower `!roll` will get the first of whatever was not chosen by the other player.
- Pick order will alternate between players.
- A tiebreaker will be played when both players are at match point.
- FreeMod will be enabled for tiebreaker.
- In the event that there is a tie on a map, the map will be replayed.

### Disconnects and missed matches

- Disconnects during a map count as losses.
- Missing a match counts as a loss; no rematches will be made.

### Misconduct and cheating

- Unsportsmanlike behavior and harassment will not be tolerated and can factor into a player's removal from the event.
- Any sort of verbal harassment towards another in the tourney will not be tolerated. This includes referees, bystanders, and any other attendees of the event.
- Players will have their computers inspected prior to the beginning of matches to ensure that there are no illegal programs running.
- Under no circumstances are players allowed to touch the peripherals or computer of another without explicit permission.
