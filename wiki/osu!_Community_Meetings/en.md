# osu! Community Meetings

The **osu! Community Meetings** are a fortnightly questions and answers panel hosted by the [osu! team](/wiki/People/The_Team). The primary aim of these meetings is to give anyone a chance to speak directly with the developers and people responsible for managing the community to raise issues for discussion or further consideration.

Long ago in the game's distant past, the osu! team used to host regular community meetings where everyone was welcome to talk. With the scale of the game today, this is no longer feasible, but through Discord a queueing system of sorts has been implemented where questions can be addressed one at a time. If you are interested in asking questions, please make sure you've read through the FAQ listed below, just in case your question has already been asked and answered!

Currently, the osu! Community Meetings are being chaired by [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2), [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335), and [smoogipoo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1040328).

The next osu! Community Meeting is scheduled to take place on: **October 31, 2021 (Sunday 01:00 UTC)**. Meetings are generally held every two weeks, with reminders announced on [peppy's Twitter](https://twitter.com/ppy) about a day beforehand.

## Getting involved

The osu! Community Meetings are currently hosted on a Discord Stage on the [osu!dev Discord](https://discord.gg/ppy), and simulcasted on [peppy's Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/ppy). Each meeting is currently scheduled to last about an hour, taking place every other Sunday 01:00 UTC. 

Everyone is welcome to join! If you have a question or have something to add to the discussion, you can raise your hand on the Discord Stage to join the queue, or write a message on the relevant Discord thread if you are not comfortable speaking, which will be read out loud and answered. In addition, before asking a question, please observe the following guidelines:

- Make sure you are verified on the server if you are interested in joining the discussions. 
- Plan your talking points ahead of time, and keep them as concise as possible.
- Try to only bring up issues which affect the larger community, not just you. 

This is to ensure that as many questions from the community as possible can be answered efficiently. The aim is ~5 minutes per question.

Please also understand that questions that have been answered before or that are especially generic may not be chosen for discussion, especially with meetings often running overtime to try and answer as many as possible.
