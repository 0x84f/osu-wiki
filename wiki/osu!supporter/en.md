- A distinctive bright yellow nickname in [chat](/wiki/Client/Interface/Chat_console)
- Access to osu!direct, the in-game beatmap search and download engine
- Relaxed limits on the number of favourited, uploaded, and downloaded [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap)
- The ability to [skin](/wiki/Skinning) (customise) more game components
- Friend, country, and [mod](/wiki/Game_modifier) [leaderboards](/wiki/Beatmap#leaderboards)
