# osu!supporter

**osu!supporter** is a temporary title given to players who support osu! by making a voluntary, monetary donation to help it thrive. Supporters receive a handful of cosmetic and technical benefits, most of which are active only when the title is present. Note that the extra features from osu!supporter will never give any advantage in gameplay, performance, or score.

The osu!supporter tag may be obtained from the [osu!supporter store page](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/supporter-tag).

## Features

### Heart badge

:::

The badge with hearts on it may usually be found next to a username. The amount of hearts depends on the duration of osu!supporter the user has acquired or received in total<!-- source: https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/blob/ac227d6abbd48630ebbf428c4e3372f388004ee5/app/Models/User.php#L1733-L1750 -->:

- Less than 1 year: 1 heart
- From 1 to 5 years: 2 hearts
- More than 5 years: 3 hearts

### Username colour

The supporters' usernames appear gold for the rest of the [chat](/wiki/Client/Interface/Chat_console) users.

### Editable profile section

Supporters receive a new profile section titled `me!`, often referred to as a userpage. The userpage serves as a personal editable space, where text is formatted using [BBCode](/wiki/BBCode). This feature is permanent and stays after the osu!supporter wears out.

The `me!` section may be a good place for:

- Banners, collabs, and infographics to spice up the profile;
- A few paragraphs or items providing insights into a player's life;
- A showcase of favourite maps, mappers, or anything else they consider important.

### Profile cover

It is possible for an osu! supporter to further customize their profile by setting up a cover image:

- Press the pencil icon in the lower right corner of the cover placeholder.
- Select a new cover from a few predefined options, or upload your own image (its dimensions should be 2400x640).

Once osu!supporter expires, the cover will be replaced with a standard one.

### One free username change

*Note: minor name changes may be requested from the account support team for free—see [Account § Can I change my account's username?](/wiki/Help_centre/Account#name-changes)*

The osu!supporter bearers are granted the ability to change their username once for free, if it's their first name change ([usual conditions apply](/wiki/Help_centre/Account#name-changes)).

### osu!direct

osu!direct is the in-game beatmap search and download engine available to the supporters. It may be accessed from the main menu by clicking the vertical `osu!direct` label on the left side of the screen. In addition to the built-in beatmap listing, osu!direct provides other ways to obtain new beatmaps without leaving the game:

- In-chat links, which point to beatmaps on the osu! website, now trigger the download prompt in-game;
- [Spectators](/wiki/Gameplay/Spectating) with osu!supporter are able to automatically download beatmaps their target is playing;
- Players with osu!supporter may opt-in to automatically linking the beatmap they are currently playing in the `#spectator` chat tab.

### Extended leaderboards

Supporters have access to several beatmap-specific [leaderboards](/wiki/Beatmap#leaderboards) available both in-game and on the website:

- Global ranking for every combination of [game modifiers](/wiki/Game_modifier);
- Country-specific ranking made of players bearing the same flag;
- Friend ranking that shows a player's position on the map compared to their friends.

### Increased limits

osu! offers more relaxed limits on different things to the supporters:

| Quota type | Regular limit | osu!supporter limit |
| :-- | :-: | :-: |
| Uploaded beatmaps | 4 + `min(ranked beatmaps, 2)` | 8 + `min(ranked beatmaps, 4)` |
| Online beatmap favourites | 100 | 1000 |
| Friend list length | 250 | 500 |

Additionally, the osu!supporter bearers are granted more lenient download speed limits, as well as the limits on amount of beatmaps downloaded per hour.

### Extra skinnable elements

After obtaining osu!supporter, some visual and aural elements of the osu! interface become skinnable:

| Element | Appearance |
| :-- | :-- |
| `menu-background.jpg` | The main menu background |
| `welcome_text.png` | The word `welcome` that appears during osu! startup |
| `welcome.wav` | The sample that plays during osu! startup |
| `seeya.wav` | The sample that plays during osu! shutdown |

- Beatmaps where a score with certain [grade](/wiki/Gameplay/Grade) was set.
