# osu!supporter

The **osu!supporter** is a *temporary* title given to the players who supported osu! by making a voluntary, monetary donation to help it thrive. Supporters receive a handful of cosmetical and technical benefits, most of which are active only when the title is present, such as:

- Distinctive bright yellow nickname in the [chat](/wiki/Client/Interface/Chat_console);
- Access to osu!direct, the in-game beatmap search and download engine;
- Relaxed limits on number of favourited or uploaded beatmaps;
- Ability to additionally skin osu!;
- Custom [leaderboards](/wiki/Beatmap#leaderboards).

The full list of perks and donation goals may be seen at the [osu!supporter promo page](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support). It is important to note that the extra features from osu!supporter will never give advantage in gameplay, performance, or score.
